		<p>Twitter Inc shares tumbled in premarket trading on Thursday after the social media platform reported weaker-than-expected growth in monthly active users in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Amid fierce competition from Facebook and Snap Inc’s messaging app, Snapchat, Twitter’s average monthly active users was 328 million in the three months through June 30.</p>
<p>Analysts were expecting 328.8 million, according to financial data and analytics firm, FactSet.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, the company had reported that it added nine million more monthly active users (MAU) than expected.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>“What matters is MAU. Overall MAU were flat, and U.S. MAU was down,” said Michael Pachter, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities.</p>
<p>Monthly active users, a key performance indicator for social networking services, is typically calculated by tabulating the number of users who have logged in and logged out during the 30-day period.</p>
<p>Twitter’s second-quarter net loss widened as it took a 55 million dollar impairment charge and revenue fell 4.7 per cent.</p>
<p>The company has been trying to boost revenue through live-streaming deals, but suffered a setback in April when it lost a deal to livestream NFL games this year to Amazon.com Inc.</p>
<p>Advertising revenue fell eight per cent to 489 million dollars , but well exceeded the 458.1 million dollars estimate.</p>
<p>The company’s net loss widened to 116.5 million dollars or 16 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30 from 107.2 million dollars or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Excluding items, the company earned eight cents per share.</p>
<p>Revenue fell about 4.7 per cent to 573.9 million dollars, the second time it has fallen since Twitter’s debut in 2013.</p>
<p>Shares of Twitter fell 8.4 per cent to 17.96 dollars in premarket trading on Thursday, following a gain of 18 per cent in the past three months.</p>

<p>Also six persons who were wounded in the attack but escaped to somewhere in Yobe State were later found dead and brought to Maiduguri.</p>
<p>Apart from the wounded soldiers admitted to military hospital in the town, two members of the Civilian JTF were as at Thursday on admission at the UMTH.</p>
<p>The Army, in a press statement on Wednesday by it’s spokesman, Brig. Gen. Sani Usman, had claimed that all the NNPC staff abducted in the Tuesday’s ambush had been rescued.</p>
<p>Usman, in the statement, said: “On receipt of the information, the Brigade mobilized and sent reinforcement, search and rescue party that include the Armed Forces Special Forces and guides that worked and pursued the terrorists throughout the night.</p>
<p>“So far, they have rescued all the NNPC staff and recovered the corpses of the Officer, 8 soldiers and a civilian who have been evacuated to 7 Division Medical Services and Hospital.</p>
<p>“The team recovered 4 vehicles one of which include a gun truck mounted with an Anti-Aircraft Gun, 2 white Hilux taken away from NNPC staff and 1 blue Hilux belonging to CJTF. The team also recovered large quantities of arms and ammunition, several spare tyres, many jerry cans of containing Petroleum, Oil and Lubricant, assorted drugs, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) making materials, reflective jackets and a Motorola handheld radio, among others. The team also neutralized many of the terrorists.”</p>
<p>But investigations by our correspondent revealed that five lecturers from the University of Maiduguri in the exploration team were killed.</p>
<p>Names of three of the lost were given as Dr. Joseph Millitus, Dr. Manaja Uba and Idris Njodi.</p>
<p>A family of one of the deceased (Dr. Joseph Millitus), Daniel Millitus told our correspondent that the family was still in grief over the lost of one of the rising stars of the family.</p>
<p>Daniel Millitus, who is a pastor in one of the parishes of Redeemed Christian Church of God in Maiduguri, said the family is making arrangements for the burial of their son.</p>
<p>Another relative of a slain lecturer (Dr. Manaja Uba), said the family was still in shock and found it difficult to believe that “Manaja was no more.”</p>
<p>She lamented that another relative (Yusuf Ibrahim) also in the exploration team is still missing.</p>
<p>When contacted on phone by journalists, the spokesman of the University of Maiduguri, Professor Danjuma Gambo, said, he was in Abuja and, therefore, has limited access to information on happenings at the institution.</p>
<p>He, however, promised to get more information on the claims as soon as he gets back on campus from Abuja.</p>
<p>The Deputy Director Army Public Relations, Col. Kingsley Samuel, when contacted on the matter, said it was not within the purview of the 7 Division where he is the spokesman.</p>
<p>He asked that: “You have to get in contact with Abuja on this, as I have no available information. It is under the 8 division.”</p>

		<p>Technology has advanced so much, giving us the ability to use fingerprints and retina scans to log into our different accounts.</p>
<p>Website Camsoda has taken that to a new level, though, creating tech that allows users to log into their site with a photograph of their penis.</p>
<p>They’re calling it ‘Dickometrics Penis Verification’ and they say it works best with erect penises, arguing that an erect penis has “more discernible features.”</p>
<p>You start by uploading a picture of your manhood to the site, then each new time you log in, simply show your penis and you’re good to go.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>The site is a webcam platform where users can stream sexually explicit content, and they’ve also been in the press for other bizarre PR stunts like creating a mask that lets you experience smells when watching virtual reality porn.</p>
<p>They also faked a shark attack with an adult film star, in a strange attempt to go viral.<br>
Camsoda’s Vice President, Darren Press, says about their Dickometrics feature: “Like a fingerprint and an eyeball, which are two of most commonly used body parts in biometric technologies, the penis has many, many differentiating factors like size, colour, and vein protrusion.</p>
<p>“However, unlike fingerprints and eyeballs, penises are not exposed to the public a lot of the time and mostly kept under clothing and shared with loved ones – presumably who are trusted.”</p>
<p>Well, what we know is that logging in anywhere other than the privacy of your own room, for example, would be a nightmare.</p>
<p>As of yet, a similar version for females has yet to be announced. Keep your fingers crossed!<br>

<p>Okorocha had, on Wednesday, through his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, described a previous statement by Fani-Kayode as an unintelligent, unprovoked and unwarranted media attack against him. He also said the former minister was living on the glory of his father and grandfather.</p>
<p>Responding, Fani-Kayode said Rochas is obsessed with him and has come to appreciate the fact that there are some things, like class, a good lineage and integrity, that money cannot buy.</p>
<p>He challenged the governor to a public debate to clear up issues between them so that Nigerians can decide for themselves who really has “native sense” between the two contenders.</p>
<p>The statement read in part “We repeat that a man who constantly speaks up for and supports a government that consistently slaughters and routinely massacres his own Igbo people can only be described as a sociopathic self-hating Igbo who is suffering from a terrible and debilitating inferiority complex.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He pointed out that Fani-Kayode would have responded to the issues he raised about the visit to President Muhammadu Buhari in London, United Kingdom, by some chieftains of the All Progressives Congress without going personal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The statement read, “And on our part, as responsible people, we had delayed in responding to Fani-Kayode’s attacks or hesitated to take issue with him because most Nigerians had, before now, doubted his intelligence quotient and have also called for certain clinical examinations.</p>

And he has always claimed that even his achievements as governor in six years have superseded or exceeded the achievements of all those who had governed the state before him put together; and has challenged anybody with contrary view to come forward so that they can compare notes.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Imo State governor added, “The problem with Nigerian politics is that everybody is equal, and that is why a man, whose story in life begins and ends with the father’s and grandfather’s names, would be abusing someone, who began life as a street hawker and became a governor and a successful man both in business and in other areas of life.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Aside from its resolve to promote financial inclusion in Nigeria, Fidelity Bank Plc says it is targeting increased earnings following its partnership with the world largest payment network, Visa, on its mVisa new payment solution.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">mVisa  is the first mobile payment solution that will operate through the use of the Quick Response code. Through this service, the user will only need to scan the QR code and input the PIN to complete the transaction.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The bank and Visa said the penetration of mVisa would accelerate e-commerce in Nigeria and across Africa, and further drive financial activities.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thus, the service had introduced the use of the QR code to reduce the amount of errors injectable through the input of payment details.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">They said, “Users of mVisa make payments by scanning a unique merchant QR code using their smartphones. Customers can initiate the payments from their mobile using mVisa application, instead of traditional card swipe on the electronic data machine.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Merchants can accept these transactions by creating a QR code using application provided to them.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Divisional Head, e-Banking at Fidelity Bank, Ifeoma Onibuje, said mVisa promises a new dawn by unlocking greater opportunities to merchants and consumers alike simply by the use of the mobile phone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She noted that the bank had been in synergy with Visa in the last 15 years on several payment solutions — from the card payment solutions to other several payment applications — to increase the chances of financial inclusivity in the country.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a statement on Wednesday, he said the picture showing the Chairman of the APC Governors’ Forum, Rochas Okorocha and three of his colleagues eating with the President had dispelled the rumour that Buhari was on the verge of death.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Faparusi said the need for Fayose’s investigation became imperative to extract information from him about where he got the “devilish information from so that the country can ascertain those plotting evil against the Federal Government.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The statement said, “Governor Fayose must tell the country what informed his interest to persistently dig unsubstantiated information about Buhari’s health if not for the fact that he was one of those plotting to stage a coup against the country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The Presidency is the symbol of our dear nation and it needs to be shielded against debasement by desperados who can do anything to grab power.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Recently, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, raised an alarm that some men of the Nigerian army were plotting to stage a coup at a time the President was out of the country. This formed the basis for why Governor Fayose must be called to question.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I quite appreciate the fact that the governor enjoys immunity under Section 308 of the 1999 Constitution, but the constitution doesn’t say he can’t be investigated. The EFCC had investigated him over alleged involvement in N2.999bn arms scandal.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The APC has it on good authority that the PDP was planning to truncate democracy under Buhari and disunite the country and Governor Fayose as the arrowhead has been intensifying efforts in this sinister scheme to the see that the President is dead.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“What marveled us was that he made the startling allegations quoting date and the location of Mr. President in London. This called for concern and should not be taken lightly.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Six of the  governors were chosen based on the six geo-political zones in the country while the governor of Zamfara State was picked because of his position as the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Umahi, who was one of the two governors from the opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party, said that it was difficult for members of the opposition to believe what they were being told by the handlers of the President that he was getting better.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He, however, said that he was happy, just like the other six governors, that the President was making progress and that he had improved very well.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The governor said the President would soon return to the country as soon as his doctors certified him alright.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “We met a cheerful President whose level of recovery is a miracle. We know he will soon return home as soon as his doctors certify him to do so. What he’s treating is not mere malaria that we can say he will return today or tomorrow.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“It is even better that, we as members of the opposition party, are among the entourage. Nigerians should continue to pray for the President. “</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Asked whether the President told them the likely date of his return, he said no, adding that there was no need to be too expectant, saying that the Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), was doing a good job.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We don’t need to panic because we have a hardworking acting President who is doing a fantastic job. All we need to do as Nigerians is to continue to pray for the President,” the governor added.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Presidency later released some pictures showing the President in a conversation with the governors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There was also a group picture showing Buhari standing with the visiting governors after the meeting.</p>

<p>In his reaction, the Medical Director of St Agatha hospital Abakaliki Dr Lawrence Ezeogo who incidentally is the elder brother of the suspect confirmed the death of the victim, Mrs Mary (his mother).</p>
<p>He said that the woman was brought to the hospital unconscious as a result of his son (Ekene) attack, disclosing that she was later diagnosed of Uterian prolapse.</p>
<p>“We referred her to another hospital because of the Uterian Prolapse that was diagnosed of her, as far as I am concerned the suspect has committed some crime, if we don’t allow Police to come into this matter and investigate it properly, it means that some other person will do the same in that family, it is a very large family of 37 children with 5 wives,” Dr Lawrence revealed.</p>
<p>When contacted, the Ebonyi State Police Public Relations Officer, Jude Madu said that he was yet to receive the report, assuring that the command would investigate the matter.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The National Coordinator of the association, Amaka Enemo, said this in Abuja on Wednesday during an interview with journalists at the presentation of  a report titled, ‘Understanding the High Risk of Urban Sexual Networks in Nigeria.’</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Enemo was said to have played an active role in gathering information for the report, which was compiled by the National Agency for the Control of AIDS, the University of Manitoba, United States, and the World Bank.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said, “Sex workers face violence, especially from their clients and law enforcement agents. Sex work is seen as a crime and the police raid streets and brothels to arrest sex workers. They collect money and if the girl cannot pay money, she will have to give sex to the policemen. If the law enforcer does not want to use condom, the sex worker has to agree and this is why HIV is on the increase.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“So, in this study, all the sex workers we interacted with said their biggest trouble was law enforcers.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 36-year-old said several studies had shown that countries where prostitution is not illegal had lower cases of sexually transmitted diseases, while Nigeria, where it is illegal, had one of the highest rates of HIV in the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said sex work should be made legal, and government should not saddle sex workers with the responsibility of paying tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Enemo said, “When I visited Amsterdam (Holland), I was able to visit the red light district where sex workers work because prostitution is legal there. I have also visited New Zealand where they have decriminalised sex work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“When you decriminalise it, there will be less exploitation of sex workers and the violence will reduce.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Emeno said since HIV is a communicable disease and had no cure, sex workers should be given proper treatment and not victimised.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said an infected sex worker could directly or indirectly infect as many as 100 people, adding that the government must not hound, but partner them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Emeno added, “Decriminalise the work so that all of us will be healthy. It might interest you to know that Nigeria has the second highest risk of HIV worldwide and we are hoping to get to zero before 2030.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“How can it end when the drivers of the epidemic are being criminalised?”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In his remarks, the Director, Strategic Knowledge Management, NACA, Dr Kayode Ogungbemi, said sex workers must be taken seriously since married men also patronised them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said the message of use of protection must also be taken to mega stores and other places where sexual relationships began.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ogungbemi added, “This report looks at the history of casual sex, transactional sex and commercial sex.

So, we must teach these women the use of condoms and going for HIV tests because if we don’t do that, they will continue to spread it. Even married people patronise them.”</p>

		<p>Quincy Jones, the legendary producer behind Michael Jackson’s top hits, on Wednesday won $9.4 million in damages from the late superstar’s estate over posthumous works.</p>
<p>A jury in Los Angeles sided with the 84-year-old producer but gave him only part of the $30 million he was seeking.</p>
<p>Jones has arranged songs for some of the biggest names in music including Jackson, producing his “Thriller” in 1982 which remains the top-selling album of all time.</p>
<p>The producer filed suit over the use of songs in “This Is It” — a 2009 documentary about Jackson’s rehearsals for a series of concerts in London that ultimately were never to be due to the star’s sudden death — as well as two Cirque du Soleil circus shows.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Jackson sued MJJ Productions Inc., one of the companies that ran the late King of Pop’s estate, in 2013.</p>
<p>Jones said he had no quarrel with Jackson personally but that he had reached contracts in 1978 and 1985 that gave him the first priority to Jackson’s music, including maintaining the right to be the first to mix original recordings.</p>
<p>“Although this judgment is not the full amount that I was seeking, I am very grateful that the jury decided in our favour in this matter,” Jones said in a statement.</p>
<p>“I view it not only as a victory for myself personally but for artists’ rights overall,” he said.</p>
<p>Defense lawyer Zia Modabber had rejected Jones’ arguments, saying that the original recordings belonged to Jackson alone.</p>
<p>“This is a grab for money that Mr. Jones isn’t entitled to,” Modabber said.</p>
<p>Another lawyer for MJJ Productions, Howard Weitzman, earlier told music magazine Billboard that the estate would likely appeal if Jones won a major sum.</p>
<p>Jackson’s estate has been trying to monetize his legacy since his death but its success has been uneven, with the family notably giving up on preserving the late King of Pop’s Neverland ranch.</p>

<p>The order was issued ahead of a mass protest called for Friday by the opposition, which is trying to force President Nicolas Maduro to scrap Sunday’s election of a body tasked with rewriting the crisis-hit country’s constitution.</p>
<p>More than 100 people have died in four months of protests against Maduro, who is increasingly relying on his security forces to maintain his authority as domestic and international criticism against him has mounted.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Lucia Vivar Hidalgo had been playing at a restaurant in the town of Pizarra not far from Malaga where her parents were eating on Wednesday evening when she walked off, a spokeswoman for the Guardia Civil police force told AFP.</p>
<p>Her parents, both of them from the region, realised she had disappeared minutes later and started looking for her.</p>

<p>Police also issued a missing persons notice with two pictures of Lucia — one of her smiling up at the camera with little pigtails.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, her body was discovered around three kilometres (two miles) away on the train tracks.</p>
<p>“The preliminary theory pre-autopsy results is that the girl started to walk, at one point she got tired and went to sleep on the train tracks,” the spokeswoman said, adding a train may then have hit her.</p>
<p>When the alarm was raised on Wednesday night, Lucia’s disappearance recalled the highly publicised plight of British girl Madeleine McCann, who vanished from her family’s holiday apartment in southern Portugal in 2007 just before her fourth birthday.</p>

<p>Okorocha had, on Wednesday, through his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, described a previous statement by Fani-Kayode as an unintelligent, unprovoked and unwarranted media attack against him. He also said the former minister was living on the glory of his father and grandfather.</p>
<p>Responding, Fani-Kayode said Rochas is obsessed with him and has come to appreciate the fact that there are some things, like class, a good lineage and integrity, that money cannot buy.</p>
<p>He challenged the governor to a public debate to clear up issues between them so that Nigerians can decide for themselves who really has “native sense” between the two contenders.</p>
<p>The statement read in part “We repeat that a man who constantly speaks up for and supports a government that consistently slaughters and routinely massacres his own Igbo people can only be described as a sociopathic self-hating Igbo who is suffering from a terrible and debilitating inferiority complex.”</p>

		<p>A three-year-old girl was found dead on train tracks in southern Spain on Thursday after her parents lost sight of her for just a few minutes at dinner the night before, police said.</p>
<p>Lucia Vivar Hidalgo had been playing at a restaurant in the town of Pizarra not far from Malaga where her parents were eating on Wednesday evening when she walked off, a spokeswoman for the Guardia Civil police force told AFP.</p>
<p>Her parents, both of them from the region, realised she had disappeared minutes later and started looking for her.</p>
<p>When they couldn’t find Lucia, they enrolled the help of locals and around 60 police officers who searched for her at night with sniffer dogs.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Police also issued a missing persons notice with two pictures of Lucia — one of her smiling up at the camera with little pigtails.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, her body was discovered around three kilometres (two miles) away on the train tracks.</p>
<p>“The preliminary theory pre-autopsy results is that the girl started to walk, at one point she got tired and went to sleep on the train tracks,” the spokeswoman said, adding a train may then have hit her.</p>
<p>When the alarm was raised on Wednesday night, Lucia’s disappearance recalled the highly publicised plight of British girl Madeleine McCann, who vanished from her family’s holiday apartment in southern Portugal in 2007 just before her fourth birthday.</p>

<p>Sources indicated that Jings, who was sworn in alongside 18 others by his successor, Mrs. Naomi Golmen, had tried to return as IMC Chairman, but was not successful as stakeholders were divided over his nomination.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Website Camsoda has taken that to a new level, though, creating tech that allows users to log into their site with a photograph of their penis.</p>
<p>They’re calling it ‘Dickometrics Penis Verification’ and they say it works best with erect penises, arguing that an erect penis has “more discernible features.”</p>
<p>You start by uploading a picture of your manhood to the site, then each new time you log in, simply show your penis and you’re good to go.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>The site is a webcam platform where users can stream sexually explicit content, and they’ve also been in the press for other bizarre PR stunts like creating a mask that lets you experience smells when watching virtual reality porn.</p>
<p>They also faked a shark attack with an adult film star, in a strange attempt to go viral.<br>
Camsoda’s Vice President, Darren Press, says about their Dickometrics feature: “Like a fingerprint and an eyeball, which are two of most commonly used body parts in biometric technologies, the penis has many, many differentiating factors like size, colour, and vein protrusion.</p>
<p>“However, unlike fingerprints and eyeballs, penises are not exposed to the public a lot of the time and mostly kept under clothing and shared with loved ones – presumably who are trusted.”</p>
<p>Well, what we know is that logging in anywhere other than the privacy of your own room, for example, would be a nightmare.</p>
<p>As of yet, a similar version for females has yet to be announced. Keep your fingers crossed!<br>

<p>Also six persons who were wounded in the attack but escaped to somewhere in Yobe State were later found dead and brought to Maiduguri.</p>
<p>Apart from the wounded soldiers admitted to military hospital in the town, two members of the Civilian JTF were as at Thursday on admission at the UMTH.</p>
<p>The Army, in a press statement on Wednesday by it’s spokesman, Brig. Gen. Sani Usman, had claimed that all the NNPC staff abducted in the Tuesday’s ambush had been rescued.</p>
<p>Usman, in the statement, said: “On receipt of the information, the Brigade mobilized and sent reinforcement, search and rescue party that include the Armed Forces Special Forces and guides that worked and pursued the terrorists throughout the night.</p>
<p>“So far, they have rescued all the NNPC staff and recovered the corpses of the Officer, 8 soldiers and a civilian who have been evacuated to 7 Division Medical Services and Hospital.</p>
<p>“The team recovered 4 vehicles one of which include a gun truck mounted with an Anti-Aircraft Gun, 2 white Hilux taken away from NNPC staff and 1 blue Hilux belonging to CJTF. The team also recovered large quantities of arms and ammunition, several spare tyres, many jerry cans of containing Petroleum, Oil and Lubricant, assorted drugs, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) making materials, reflective jackets and a Motorola handheld radio, among others. The team also neutralized many of the terrorists.”</p>
<p>But investigations by our correspondent revealed that five lecturers from the University of Maiduguri in the exploration team were killed.</p>
<p>Names of three of the lost were given as Dr. Joseph Millitus, Dr. Manaja Uba and Idris Njodi.</p>
<p>A family of one of the deceased (Dr. Joseph Millitus), Daniel Millitus told our correspondent that the family was still in grief over the lost of one of the rising stars of the family.</p>
<p>Daniel Millitus, who is a pastor in one of the parishes of Redeemed Christian Church of God in Maiduguri, said the family is making arrangements for the burial of their son.</p>
<p>Another relative of a slain lecturer (Dr. Manaja Uba), said the family was still in shock and found it difficult to believe that “Manaja was no more.”</p>
<p>She lamented that another relative (Yusuf Ibrahim) also in the exploration team is still missing.</p>
<p>When contacted on phone by journalists, the spokesman of the University of Maiduguri, Professor Danjuma Gambo, said, he was in Abuja and, therefore, has limited access to information on happenings at the institution.</p>
<p>He, however, promised to get more information on the claims as soon as he gets back on campus from Abuja.</p>
<p>The Deputy Director Army Public Relations, Col. Kingsley Samuel, when contacted on the matter, said it was not within the purview of the 7 Division where he is the spokesman.</p>
<p>He asked that: “You have to get in contact with Abuja on this, as I have no available information. It is under the 8 division.”</p>

<p>Forty-eight corpses of persons killed by Boko Haram insurgents during an oil exploration to the Lake Chad Basin have been brought to the Maiduguri Teaching Hospital in the Borno State capital.</p>
<p>Sources at the UMTH and the Maimalari Army Barrack told The PUNCH that the corpses were brought into Maiduguri from the scene of the attack.</p>
<p>The corpses brought include 18 soldiers, 15 Civilian JTF, five university staff and four NNPC drivers.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Also six persons who were wounded in the attack but escaped to somewhere in Yobe State were later found dead and brought to Maiduguri.</p>
<p>Apart from the wounded soldiers admitted to military hospital in the town, two members of the Civilian JTF were as at Thursday on admission at the UMTH.</p>
<p>The Army, in a press statement on Wednesday by it’s spokesman, Brig. Gen. Sani Usman, had claimed that all the NNPC staff abducted in the Tuesday’s ambush had been rescued.</p>
<p>Usman, in the statement, said: “On receipt of the information, the Brigade mobilized and sent reinforcement, search and rescue party that include the Armed Forces Special Forces and guides that worked and pursued the terrorists throughout the night.</p>
<p>“So far, they have rescued all the NNPC staff and recovered the corpses of the Officer, 8 soldiers and a civilian who have been evacuated to 7 Division Medical Services and Hospital.</p>
<p>“The team recovered 4 vehicles one of which include a gun truck mounted with an Anti-Aircraft Gun, 2 white Hilux taken away from NNPC staff and 1 blue Hilux belonging to CJTF. The team also recovered large quantities of arms and ammunition, several spare tyres, many jerry cans of containing Petroleum, Oil and Lubricant, assorted drugs, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) making materials, reflective jackets and a Motorola handheld radio, among others. The team also neutralized many of the terrorists.”</p>
<p>But investigations by our correspondent revealed that five lecturers from the University of Maiduguri in the exploration team were killed.</p>
<p>Names of three of the lost were given as Dr. Joseph Millitus, Dr. Manaja Uba and Idris Njodi.</p>
<p>A family of one of the deceased (Dr. Joseph Millitus), Daniel Millitus told our correspondent that the family was still in grief over the lost of one of the rising stars of the family.</p>
<p>Daniel Millitus, who is a pastor in one of the parishes of Redeemed Christian Church of God in Maiduguri, said the family is making arrangements for the burial of their son.</p>
<p>Another relative of a slain lecturer (Dr. Manaja Uba), said the family was still in shock and found it difficult to believe that “Manaja was no more.”</p>
<p>She lamented that another relative (Yusuf Ibrahim) also in the exploration team is still missing.</p>
<p>When contacted on phone by journalists, the spokesman of the University of Maiduguri, Professor Danjuma Gambo, said, he was in Abuja and, therefore, has limited access to information on happenings at the institution.</p>
<p>He, however, promised to get more information on the claims as soon as he gets back on campus from Abuja.</p>
<p>The Deputy Director Army Public Relations, Col. Kingsley Samuel, when contacted on the matter, said it was not within the purview of the 7 Division where he is the spokesman.</p>
<p>He asked that: “You have to get in contact with Abuja on this, as I have no available information. It is under the 8 division.”</p>

<p>They’re calling it ‘Dickometrics Penis Verification’ and they say it works best with erect penises, arguing that an erect penis has “more discernible features.”</p>

<p>The site is a webcam platform where users can stream sexually explicit content, and they’ve also been in the press for other bizarre PR stunts like creating a mask that lets you experience smells when watching virtual reality porn.</p>
<p>They also faked a shark attack with an adult film star, in a strange attempt to go viral.<br>
Camsoda’s Vice President, Darren Press, says about their Dickometrics feature: “Like a fingerprint and an eyeball, which are two of most commonly used body parts in biometric technologies, the penis has many, many differentiating factors like size, colour, and vein protrusion.</p>
<p>“However, unlike fingerprints and eyeballs, penises are not exposed to the public a lot of the time and mostly kept under clothing and shared with loved ones – presumably who are trusted.”</p>
<p>Well, what we know is that logging in anywhere other than the privacy of your own room, for example, would be a nightmare.</p>
<p>As of yet, a similar version for females has yet to be announced. Keep your fingers crossed!<br>

<p>Police also issued a missing persons notice with two pictures of Lucia — one of her smiling up at the camera with little pigtails.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, her body was discovered around three kilometres (two miles) away on the train tracks.</p>
<p>“The preliminary theory pre-autopsy results is that the girl started to walk, at one point she got tired and went to sleep on the train tracks,” the spokeswoman said, adding a train may then have hit her.</p>
<p>When the alarm was raised on Wednesday night, Lucia’s disappearance recalled the highly publicised plight of British girl Madeleine McCann, who vanished from her family’s holiday apartment in southern Portugal in 2007 just before her fourth birthday.</p>

<p>Okorocha had, on Wednesday, through his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, described a previous statement by Fani-Kayode as an unintelligent, unprovoked and unwarranted media attack against him. He also said the former minister was living on the glory of his father and grandfather.</p>
<p>Responding, Fani-Kayode said Rochas is obsessed with him and has come to appreciate the fact that there are some things, like class, a good lineage and integrity, that money cannot buy.</p>
<p>He challenged the governor to a public debate to clear up issues between them so that Nigerians can decide for themselves who really has “native sense” between the two contenders.</p>
<p>The statement read in part “We repeat that a man who constantly speaks up for and supports a government that consistently slaughters and routinely massacres his own Igbo people can only be described as a sociopathic self-hating Igbo who is suffering from a terrible and debilitating inferiority complex.”</p>

<p>Twitter’s second-quarter net loss widened as it took a 55 million dollar impairment charge and revenue fell 4.7 per cent.</p>
<p>The company has been trying to boost revenue through live-streaming deals, but suffered a setback in April when it lost a deal to livestream NFL games this year to Amazon.com Inc.</p>
<p>Advertising revenue fell eight per cent to 489 million dollars , but well exceeded the 458.1 million dollars estimate.</p>
<p>The company’s net loss widened to 116.5 million dollars or 16 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30 from 107.2 million dollars or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Excluding items, the company earned eight cents per share.</p>
<p>Revenue fell about 4.7 per cent to 573.9 million dollars, the second time it has fallen since Twitter’s debut in 2013.</p>
<p>Shares of Twitter fell 8.4 per cent to 17.96 dollars in premarket trading on Thursday, following a gain of 18 per cent in the past three months.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Imo State governor added, “The problem with Nigerian politics is that everybody is equal, and that is why a man, whose story in life begins and ends with the father’s and grandfather’s names, would be abusing someone, who began life as a street hawker and became a governor and a successful man both in business and in other areas of life.

		<p>A middle aged man, identified as Ekene Ezeogo, has allegedly beaten his mother to death following a squabble that erupted in their residence located at No 24 Agbaja Road in Abakaliki Ebonyi State capital.</p>
<p>Findings revealed that the incident occurred on Wednesday when the woman identified as Prophetess Mary intervened in a fight that ensued between the suspect Ekene and his younger sister.</p>
<p>It was gathered that the case had been reported to the Central Police Station Abakaliki, but the suspect was yet to be arrested at the time of filling this report.</p>
<p>During a visit to the residence of the victim at 24 Agbaja Road Abakaliki by The PUNCH, it was obvious that all was not well as sympathizers sighted within the compound were in mourning mood.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Confirming the incident, the suspect’s step brother, Onyema Ezeogo, disclosed that Ekene’s mother died after her son pushed her to the ground and she hit her stomach on the ground.</p>
<p>“Ekene beat his mother and brush her down, the mother hit her tommy on the ground, Ekene carried her to St Agatha hospital for treatment, unfortunately she could not make it , the Doctor certified her dead,”he narrated.</p>
<p>Collaborating the story, a tenant in the victim compound who gave his name as Chinedu Sunday (m) told news men that he was working with the victim as a Missionary and expressed shock over the tragic killing of the woman, stating that other members of the family had been taken to another residential home for safety.</p>
<p>In his reaction, the Medical Director of St Agatha hospital Abakaliki Dr Lawrence Ezeogo who incidentally is the elder brother of the suspect confirmed the death of the victim, Mrs Mary (his mother).</p>
<p>He said that the woman was brought to the hospital unconscious as a result of his son (Ekene) attack, disclosing that she was later diagnosed of Uterian prolapse.</p>
<p>“We referred her to another hospital because of the Uterian Prolapse that was diagnosed of her, as far as I am concerned the suspect has committed some crime, if we don’t allow Police to come into this matter and investigate it properly, it means that some other person will do the same in that family, it is a very large family of 37 children with 5 wives,” Dr Lawrence revealed.</p>
<p>When contacted, the Ebonyi State Police Public Relations Officer, Jude Madu said that he was yet to receive the report, assuring that the command would investigate the matter.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a statement on Wednesday, he said the picture showing the Chairman of the APC Governors’ Forum, Rochas Okorocha and three of his colleagues eating with the President had dispelled the rumour that Buhari was on the verge of death.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Faparusi said the need for Fayose’s investigation became imperative to extract information from him about where he got the “devilish information from so that the country can ascertain those plotting evil against the Federal Government.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The statement said, “Governor Fayose must tell the country what informed his interest to persistently dig unsubstantiated information about Buhari’s health if not for the fact that he was one of those plotting to stage a coup against the country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The Presidency is the symbol of our dear nation and it needs to be shielded against debasement by desperados who can do anything to grab power.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Recently, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I quite appreciate the fact that the governor enjoys immunity under Section 308 of the 1999 Constitution, but the constitution doesn’t say he can’t be investigated. The EFCC had investigated him over alleged involvement in N2.999bn arms scandal.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Six of the  governors were chosen based on the six geo-political zones in the country while the governor of Zamfara State was picked because of his position as the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He, however, said that he was happy, just like the other six governors, that the President was making progress and that he had improved very well.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The governor said the President would soon return to the country as soon as his doctors certified him alright.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “We met a cheerful President whose level of recovery is a miracle. We know he will soon return home as soon as his doctors certify him to do so. What he’s treating is not mere malaria that we can say he will return today or tomorrow.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“It is even better that, we as members of the opposition party, are among the entourage. Nigerians should continue to pray for the President. “</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Asked whether the President told them the likely date of his return, he said no, adding that there was no need to be too expectant, saying that the Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), was doing a good job.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We don’t need to panic because we have a hardworking acting President who is doing a fantastic job. All we need to do as Nigerians is to continue to pray for the President,” the governor added.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Presidency later released some pictures showing the President in a conversation with the governors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There was also a group picture showing Buhari standing with the visiting governors after the meeting.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thus, the service had introduced the use of the QR code to reduce the amount of errors injectable through the input of payment details.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">They said, “Users of mVisa make payments by scanning a unique merchant QR code using their smartphones. Customers can initiate the payments from their mobile using mVisa application, instead of traditional card swipe on the electronic data machine.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Merchants can accept these transactions by creating a QR code using application provided to them.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Divisional Head, e-Banking at Fidelity Bank, Ifeoma Onibuje, said mVisa promises a new dawn by unlocking greater opportunities to merchants and consumers alike simply by the use of the mobile phone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She noted that the bank had been in synergy with Visa in the last 15 years on several payment solutions — from the card payment solutions to other several payment applications — to increase the chances of financial inclusivity in the country.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The National Coordinator of the association, Amaka Enemo, said this in Abuja on Wednesday during an interview with journalists at the presentation of  a report titled, ‘Understanding the High Risk of Urban Sexual Networks in Nigeria.’</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Enemo was said to have played an active role in gathering information for the report, which was compiled by the National Agency for the Control of AIDS, the University of Manitoba, United States, and the World Bank.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said, “Sex workers face violence, especially from their clients and law enforcement agents. Sex work is seen as a crime and the police raid streets and brothels to arrest sex workers. They collect money and if the girl cannot pay money, she will have to give sex to the policemen. If the law enforcer does not want to use condom, the sex worker has to agree and this is why HIV is on the increase.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“So, in this study, all the sex workers we interacted with said their biggest trouble was law enforcers.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 36-year-old said several studies had shown that countries where prostitution is not illegal had lower cases of sexually transmitted diseases, while Nigeria, where it is illegal, had one of the highest rates of HIV in the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said sex work should be made legal, and government should not saddle sex workers with the responsibility of paying tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Enemo said, “When I visited Amsterdam (Holland), I was able to visit the red light district where sex workers work because prostitution is legal there. I have also visited New Zealand where they have decriminalised sex work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“When you decriminalise it, there will be less exploitation of sex workers and the violence will reduce.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Emeno said since HIV is a communicable disease and had no cure, sex workers should be given proper treatment and not victimised.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said an infected sex worker could directly or indirectly infect as many as 100 people, adding that the government must not hound, but partner them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Emeno added, “Decriminalise the work so that all of us will be healthy. It might interest you to know that Nigeria has the second highest risk of HIV worldwide and we are hoping to get to zero before 2030.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“How can it end when the drivers of the epidemic are being criminalised?”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In his remarks, the Director, Strategic Knowledge Management, NACA, Dr Kayode Ogungbemi, said sex workers must be taken seriously since married men also patronised them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said the message of use of protection must also be taken to mega stores and other places where sexual relationships began.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ogungbemi added, “This report looks at the history of casual sex, transactional sex and commercial sex. If we do not reach these women, the infection will continue to spread. So, we must teach these women the use of condoms and going for HIV tests because if we don’t do that, they will continue to spread it. Even married people patronise them.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Also speaking, the Country Coordinator, Centre for Global Public Health, University of Manitoba, Dr. Kalada Green, said the exercise, which was funded by the World Bank, was done in order to improve the efficiency of HIV prevention methods.</p>

		<p>Quincy Jones, the legendary producer behind Michael Jackson’s top hits, on Wednesday won $9.4 million in damages from the late superstar’s estate over posthumous works.</p>
<p>A jury in Los Angeles sided with the 84-year-old producer but gave him only part of the $30 million he was seeking.</p>
<p>Jones has arranged songs for some of the biggest names in music including Jackson, producing his “Thriller” in 1982 which remains the top-selling album of all time.</p>
<p>The producer filed suit over the use of songs in “This Is It” — a 2009 documentary about Jackson’s rehearsals for a series of concerts in London that ultimately were never to be due to the star’s sudden death — as well as two Cirque du Soleil circus shows.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Jackson sued MJJ Productions Inc., one of the companies that ran the late King of Pop’s estate, in 2013.</p>
<p>Jones said he had no quarrel with Jackson personally but that he had reached contracts in 1978 and 1985 that gave him the first priority to Jackson’s music, including maintaining the right to be the first to mix original recordings.</p>
<p>“Although this judgment is not the full amount that I was seeking, I am very grateful that the jury decided in our favour in this matter,” Jones said in a statement.</p>
<p>“I view it not only as a victory for myself personally but for artists’ rights overall,” he said.</p>
<p>Defense lawyer Zia Modabber had rejected Jones’ arguments, saying that the original recordings belonged to Jackson alone.</p>
<p>“This is a grab for money that Mr. Jones isn’t entitled to,” Modabber said.</p>
<p>Another lawyer for MJJ Productions, Howard Weitzman, earlier told music magazine Billboard that the estate would likely appeal if Jones won a major sum.</p>
<p>Jackson’s estate has been trying to monetize his legacy since his death but its success has been uneven, with the family notably giving up on preserving the late King of Pop’s Neverland ranch.</p>

		<p>Diageo, the British maker of alcoholic drinks including Guinness stout, said Thursday that annual profits soared more than a fifth, aided partly by the pound weakening on Brexit uncertainty.</p>

<p>Since the apex court delivered its judgment on June 23, the House had not sworn her in despite several attempts by the Benue politician to that effect.</p>
<p>The delay in swearing her in had forced Mato and her supporters to accuse the House leadership of frustrating her attempts to occupy her seat and discharge her responsibilities as an elected lawmaker.</p>
<p>“By the time the House resumes from recess, Mato would have completed all the processes for her to be sworn-in as Hembe’s replacement.</p>
<p>“Our tenure hasn’t elapsed. We are going on a break and when she is through, we can still swear her in.</p>

<p>The site is a webcam platform where users can stream sexually explicit content, and they’ve also been in the press for other bizarre PR stunts like creating a mask that lets you experience smells when watching virtual reality porn.</p>
<p>They also faked a shark attack with an adult film star, in a strange attempt to go viral.<br>
Camsoda’s Vice President, Darren Press, says about their Dickometrics feature: “Like a fingerprint and an eyeball, which are two of most commonly used body parts in biometric technologies, the penis has many, many differentiating factors like size, colour, and vein protrusion.</p>
<p>“However, unlike fingerprints and eyeballs, penises are not exposed to the public a lot of the time and mostly kept under clothing and shared with loved ones – presumably who are trusted.”</p>
<p>Well, what we know is that logging in anywhere other than the privacy of your own room, for example, would be a nightmare.</p>
<p>As of yet, a similar version for females has yet to be announced. Keep your fingers crossed!<br>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thus, the service had introduced the use of the QR code to reduce the amount of errors injectable through the input of payment details.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">They said, “Users of mVisa make payments by scanning a unique merchant QR code using their smartphones. Customers can initiate the payments from their mobile using mVisa application, instead of traditional card swipe on the electronic data machine.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Merchants can accept these transactions by creating a QR code using application provided to them.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Divisional Head, e-Banking at Fidelity Bank, Ifeoma Onibuje, said mVisa promises a new dawn by unlocking greater opportunities to merchants and consumers alike simply by the use of the mobile phone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She noted that the bank had been in synergy with Visa in the last 15 years on several payment solutions — from the card payment solutions to other several payment applications — to increase the chances of financial inclusivity in the country.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Nigerian Sex Workers Association has called on the Federal Government to decriminalise prostitution, saying such would curb the spread of HIV.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The association added that HIV infection had continued to increase because the government treated prostitution as a crime.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It stated that law enforcement agents, especially the police, consequently harassed sex workers and sometimes demand sex without using condoms.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The National Coordinator of the association, Amaka Enemo, said this in Abuja on Wednesday during an interview with journalists at the presentation of  a report titled, ‘Understanding the High Risk of Urban Sexual Networks in Nigeria.’</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Enemo was said to have played an active role in gathering information for the report, which was compiled by the National Agency for the Control of AIDS, the University of Manitoba, United States, and the World Bank.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said, “Sex workers face violence, especially from their clients and law enforcement agents. Sex work is seen as a crime and the police raid streets and brothels to arrest sex workers. They collect money and if the girl cannot pay money, she will have to give sex to the policemen. If the law enforcer does not want to use condom, the sex worker has to agree and this is why HIV is on the increase.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“So, in this study, all the sex workers we interacted with said their biggest trouble was law enforcers.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 36-year-old said several studies had shown that countries where prostitution is not illegal had lower cases of sexually transmitted diseases, while Nigeria, where it is illegal, had one of the highest rates of HIV in the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said sex work should be made legal, and government should not saddle sex workers with the responsibility of paying tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Enemo said, “When I visited Amsterdam (Holland), I was able to visit the red light district where sex workers work because prostitution is legal there. I have also visited New Zealand where they have decriminalised sex work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“When you decriminalise it, there will be less exploitation of sex workers and the violence will reduce.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Emeno said since HIV is a communicable disease and had no cure, sex workers should be given proper treatment and not victimised.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said an infected sex worker could directly or indirectly infect as many as 100 people, adding that the government must not hound, but partner them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Emeno added, “Decriminalise the work so that all of us will be healthy. It might interest you to know that Nigeria has the second highest risk of HIV worldwide and we are hoping to get to zero before 2030.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“How can it end when the drivers of the epidemic are being criminalised?”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In his remarks, the Director, Strategic Knowledge Management, NACA, Dr Kayode Ogungbemi, said sex workers must be taken seriously since married men also patronised them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said the message of use of protection must also be taken to mega stores and other places where sexual relationships began.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ogungbemi added, “This report looks at the history of casual sex, transactional sex and commercial sex. If we do not reach these women, the infection will continue to spread. So, we must teach these women the use of condoms and going for HIV tests because if we don’t do that, they will continue to spread it. Even married people patronise them.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Also speaking, the Country Coordinator, Centre for Global Public Health, University of Manitoba, Dr. Kalada Green, said the exercise, which was funded by the World Bank, was done in order to improve the efficiency of HIV prevention methods.</p>

<p>The corpses brought include 18 soldiers, 15 Civilian JTF, five university staff and four NNPC drivers.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Also six persons who were wounded in the attack but escaped to somewhere in Yobe State were later found dead and brought to Maiduguri.</p>
<p>Apart from the wounded soldiers admitted to military hospital in the town, two members of the Civilian JTF were as at Thursday on admission at the UMTH.</p>
<p>The Army, in a press statement on Wednesday by it’s spokesman, Brig. Gen. Sani Usman, had claimed that all the NNPC staff abducted in the Tuesday’s ambush had been rescued.</p>
<p>Usman, in the statement, said: “On receipt of the information, the Brigade mobilized and sent reinforcement, search and rescue party that include the Armed Forces Special Forces and guides that worked and pursued the terrorists throughout the night.</p>
<p>“So far, they have rescued all the NNPC staff and recovered the corpses of the Officer, 8 soldiers and a civilian who have been evacuated to 7 Division Medical Services and Hospital.</p>
<p>“The team recovered 4 vehicles one of which include a gun truck mounted with an Anti-Aircraft Gun, 2 white Hilux taken away from NNPC staff and 1 blue Hilux belonging to CJTF. The team also recovered large quantities of arms and ammunition, several spare tyres, many jerry cans of containing Petroleum, Oil and Lubricant, assorted drugs, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) making materials, reflective jackets and a Motorola handheld radio, among others. The team also neutralized many of the terrorists.”</p>
<p>But investigations by our correspondent revealed that five lecturers from the University of Maiduguri in the exploration team were killed.</p>
<p>Names of three of the lost were given as Dr. Joseph Millitus, Dr. Manaja Uba and Idris Njodi.</p>
<p>A family of one of the deceased (Dr. Joseph Millitus), Daniel Millitus told our correspondent that the family was still in grief over the lost of one of the rising stars of the family.</p>
<p>Daniel Millitus, who is a pastor in one of the parishes of Redeemed Christian Church of God in Maiduguri, said the family is making arrangements for the burial of their son.</p>
<p>Another relative of a slain lecturer (Dr. Manaja Uba), said the family was still in shock and found it difficult to believe that “Manaja was no more.”</p>
<p>She lamented that another relative (Yusuf Ibrahim) also in the exploration team is still missing.</p>
<p>When contacted on phone by journalists, the spokesman of the University of Maiduguri, Professor Danjuma Gambo, said, he was in Abuja and, therefore, has limited access to information on happenings at the institution.</p>
<p>He, however, promised to get more information on the claims as soon as he gets back on campus from Abuja.</p>
<p>The Deputy Director Army Public Relations, Col. Kingsley Samuel, when contacted on the matter, said it was not within the purview of the 7 Division where he is the spokesman.</p>
<p>He asked that: “You have to get in contact with Abuja on this, as I have no available information. It is under the 8 division.”</p>

<p>“We referred her to another hospital because of the Uterian Prolapse that was diagnosed of her, as far as I am concerned the suspect has committed some crime, if we don’t allow Police to come into this matter and investigate it properly, it means that some other person will do the same in that family, it is a very large family of 37 children with 5 wives,” Dr Lawrence revealed.</p>

		<p>Venezuela’s government on Thursday issued a ban on protests against a controversial weekend election that has already been the focus of deadly street demonstrations.</p>
<p>From Friday, those taking part in rallies, demonstrations, marches or similar events that “could disturb or affect” the vote would face between five and 10 years in prison, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said.</p>
<p>The order was issued ahead of a mass protest called for Friday by the opposition, which is trying to force President Nicolas Maduro to scrap Sunday’s election of a body tasked with rewriting the crisis-hit country’s constitution.</p>
<p>More than 100 people have died in four months of protests against Maduro, who is increasingly relying on his security forces to maintain his authority as domestic and international criticism against him has mounted.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a statement on Wednesday, he said the picture showing the Chairman of the APC Governors’ Forum, Rochas Okorocha and three of his colleagues eating with the President had dispelled the rumour that Buhari was on the verge of death.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Faparusi said the need for Fayose’s investigation became imperative to extract information from him about where he got the “devilish information from so that the country can ascertain those plotting evil against the Federal Government.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The statement said, “Governor Fayose must tell the country what informed his interest to persistently dig unsubstantiated information about Buhari’s health if not for the fact that he was one of those plotting to stage a coup against the country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The Presidency is the symbol of our dear nation and it needs to be shielded against debasement by desperados who can do anything to grab power.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Recently, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, raised an alarm that some men of the Nigerian army were plotting to stage a coup at a time the President was out of the country. This formed the basis for why Governor Fayose must be called to question.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I quite appreciate the fact that the governor enjoys immunity under Section 308 of the 1999 Constitution, but the constitution doesn’t say he can’t be investigated. The EFCC had investigated him over alleged involvement in N2.999bn arms scandal.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The APC has it on good authority that the PDP was planning to truncate democracy under Buhari and disunite the country and Governor Fayose as the arrowhead has been intensifying efforts in this sinister scheme to the see that the President is dead.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“What marveled us was that he made the startling allegations quoting date and the location of Mr. President in London. This called for concern and should not be taken lightly.”</p>

		<p>A three-year-old girl was found dead on train tracks in southern Spain on Thursday after her parents lost sight of her for just a few minutes at dinner the night before, police said.</p>
<p>Lucia Vivar Hidalgo had been playing at a restaurant in the town of Pizarra not far from Malaga where her parents were eating on Wednesday evening when she walked off, a spokeswoman for the Guardia Civil police force told AFP.</p>
<p>Her parents, both of them from the region, realised she had disappeared minutes later and started looking for her.</p>
<p>When they couldn’t find Lucia, they enrolled the help of locals and around 60 police officers who searched for her at night with sniffer dogs.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Police also issued a missing persons notice with two pictures of Lucia — one of her smiling up at the camera with little pigtails.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, her body was discovered around three kilometres (two miles) away on the train tracks.</p>
<p>“The preliminary theory pre-autopsy results is that the girl started to walk, at one point she got tired and went to sleep on the train tracks,” the spokeswoman said, adding a train may then have hit her.</p>
<p>When the alarm was raised on Wednesday night, Lucia’s disappearance recalled the highly publicised plight of British girl Madeleine McCann, who vanished from her family’s holiday apartment in southern Portugal in 2007 just before her fourth birthday.</p>

<p>Okorocha had, on Wednesday, through his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, described a previous statement by Fani-Kayode as an unintelligent, unprovoked and unwarranted media attack against him. He also said the former minister was living on the glory of his father and grandfather.</p>
<p>Responding, Fani-Kayode said Rochas is obsessed with him and has come to appreciate the fact that there are some things, like class, a good lineage and integrity, that money cannot buy.</p>
<p>He challenged the governor to a public debate to clear up issues between them so that Nigerians can decide for themselves who really has “native sense” between the two contenders.</p>
<p>The statement read in part “We repeat that a man who constantly speaks up for and supports a government that consistently slaughters and routinely massacres his own Igbo people can only be described as a sociopathic self-hating Igbo who is suffering from a terrible and debilitating inferiority complex.”</p>

<p>The statement added that Fani-Kayode and Okorocha can not be compared at all.</p>
<p>“FFK was never a ritualist, a cultist, a 419er, a sodomite, a traitor nor a dirty and unreliable street urchin and scammer.</p>
<p>“He never ruined the lives of millions, bowed before strange gods and slept in coffins to make his money.</p>

<p>Bola is seeking divorce on the grounds of joblessness and laziness on the part of her husband, Gbenga.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Reacting on Wednesday through his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, Okorocha described the former minister’s statement as an unintelligent, unprovoked and unwarranted media attack against him.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He pointed out that Fani-Kayode would have responded to the issues he raised about the visit to President Muhammadu Buhari in London, United Kingdom, by some chieftains of the All Progressives Congress without going personal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The statement read, “And on our part, as responsible people, we had delayed in responding to Fani-Kayode’s attacks or hesitated to take issue with him because most Nigerians had, before now, doubted his intelligence quotient and have also called for certain clinical examinations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Again, there is obviously a very wide gulf between a man, who has succeeded in every segment of life through the dint of hard work and indeed, by God’s grace, and someone whose only claim in society or his only meal ticket is the late father’s name.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“And we also know that spoiled and over-pampered children do not know what it takes to have self-discipline and respect for others. They see everybody as ice-cream, tom-tom, yoghurt and indomie noddles. Hence they can abuse anybody not minding the gaps.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Rochas Okorocha has succeeded in business, in politics, in education and as governor without brandishing any name except God. And he has always claimed that even his achievements as governor in six years have superseded or exceeded the achievements of all those who had governed the state before him put together; and has challenged anybody with contrary view to come forward so that they can compare notes.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Imo State governor added, “The problem with Nigerian politics is that everybody is equal, and that is why a man, whose story in life begins and ends with the father’s and grandfather’s names, would be abusing someone, who began life as a street hawker and became a governor and a successful man both in business and in other areas of life.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“One would have thought that the excruciating damage inflicted on Dr. Goodluck Jonathan and the Peoples Democratic Party by this same guy would have humbled him.

“I want that fund supporting African online businesses,” said Mr. Ma, who is Special Adviser to UNCTAD for Youth Entrepreneurship and Small Business.</p><p>“The money is set. This is my money, so I don’t have to get anybody’s approval,” he said, adding that he was poised to hire staff for the fund, set to begin operations this year.</p><p>Mr. Ma said that he would also work with UNCTAD help bring 200 budding African businesspeople to his homeland China to learn from Alibaba hands on.</p><p>“I want them to go to China, meeting our people, seeing all the things we have been doing, all the great ideas China has,” he said.</p><p>“They know what they want. And when they know what they want, we can support it,” he added.</p><p>In addition, Mr. Ma said that he planned to roll out a partnership with African universities to teach internet technology, artificial intelligence and e-commerce.</p><p>Mr. Ma, who is on his first visit to Africa, also visited Kenya on Thursday. He has been sharing his experience of having built his company, founded in 1999, into a global e-commerce giant valued at more than US$231 billion, and how he met the string of challenges that he faced along the way.</p><p>The Youth Connekt Africa Summit, held in Kigali, brought together more than 1,500 participants from government, entrepreneurial and investor communities, multinationals, and startups shaping the African technological ecosystem. Unlocking Africa's e-commerce is a key priority for UNCTAD, given the potential of online trade to power development.</p><p>""African entrepreneurs should not be asking successful businesses, 'How can I distribute your products?' Africans should be saying, 'I have an idea I want to grow – how can you help me to grow it? How can you help me market it?',"" said UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi.</p><p>UNCTAD is working with Mr. Ma to explore opportunities with African businesses to participate in global trade, as well as to raise awareness of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by the international community in 2015. In addition to his role as an adviser to UNCTAD, Mr. Ma also serves as a UN Sustainable Development Goals Advocate.</p><p>Mr. Ma underscored the importance of internet access in all nations, saying it was an even more important raw material for economies than coal and electricity were in the past.</p><p>""Not being connected to the internet today is worse than not having electricity 100 years ago,"" he said.</p><p>He also pointed to the big implications for economies and the labour market.</p><p>“I think e-commerce, Internet, Big Data is the future. You can never stop it. You like it or don’t like it. But you will never stop it,” he said.</p><p>“Every time you have a technological revolution, it will kill a lot of jobs and it will create a lot of jobs. This is what history tells us.”</p><p></p>"

That underscores the need for an integrated roadmap and fundraising strategy in order to advance capacity-building based on the key pillars of monitoring and evaluation. Ms. Bajwa cautioned that a short-term focus on results to feed the SDG follow-up and review process, at the expense of longer-term monitoring and evaluation systems development, would ultimately lead to wasted resources. </p><p>Ambassador Modest Jonathan Mero, Permanent Representative of Tanzania to the United Nations, expressed appreciation for UNCTAD's support and welcomed additional efforts to strengthen evaluation capacities. ""Strong monitoring and evaluation is needed to identify catalytic actions or SDG accelerators that can have maximum impact across various goals and targets since not all goals can be pursued equally and in tandem,"" he noted. He also suggested an SDG tracking system such as a ""scorecard"", as well as regular evaluations. </p><p>Ms. Chantal Line Carpentier, Chief of the UNCTAD New York Office and moderator of the session, stressed, ""If there is one key message that I hope you leave today with, it will be the importance of going beyond statistics and data to assess progress against the SDGs."" </p><p>Mr. Indran Naidoo, Director of the Independent Evaluation Office of UNDP and Vice-chair of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG), and Ms. Inga Sniukaite, Deputy Director of the Independent Evaluation Office at UN Women, also presented experiences and perspectives in developing gender-responsive national evaluation capacities to achieve the SDGs. </p><p>The session attracted government representatives attending the HLPF, civil society, academia, UNEG members and professional evaluators. Interactive discussions with the audience following the presentations discussed the way forward for capacity-building. </p><p>UNCTAD will continue to emphasize a systems approach to monitoring and evaluation at the country-level through partnerships within the UN family and beyond.</p>"

From a statistical perspective the monitoring framework for the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will pose a very significant technical and coordination challenge for countries, their national statistical systems and their broader data ecosystems. The complexity and ambition of this challenge led Mogens Lykketoft, President of the UN General Assembly to describe it as an 'unprecedented statistical challenge'. The challenge for evaluation will be no less. </p><p> </p><p>The seminars focused on broad strategic issues, such as, how to achieve a sustainable balance between fulfilling the informational needs to support national policy priorities and countries global responsibilities. Discussions included how national data needs and SDG indicator requirements might be aligned in a symbiotic way, so that information needs, not just for performance indicators, but also the input data required to support policy formulation and the data needed to properly evaluate the success of national development plans might be married or coordinated.</p><p>The seminars also addressed other practical issues, such as within country coordination, and between respective Tanzanian and Zanzibarian statistical systems, and with the United Nations, all of which will pose new challenges as many of the targets (and consequent indicators) fall well outside the scope of traditional official statistics and thus are not guided by agreed international measurement standards.</p><p>Others questions discussed included the approach of Tanzanian and Zanzibarian statistical authorities to Tier II and Tier III indicators and what steps they can take to find common approaches to quality assurance and adherence to international standards.</p><p>The technical workshops were designed to improve the technical capacities of subject matter experts. These workshops focused on a number of cross-cutting topics, such as, data analyses, data visualization and monitoring &amp; evaluation. There were also very specific sessions on how to compile national and SDG trade and trade-related indicators.</p><p>Over the course of 4 days, 116 participants took part. For the seminar sessions, 72% of participants stated their expectations were met, with the remaining 28% saying their expectations were exceeded. For the technical workshops, the feedback was more mixed, with many participants stating that they would have preferred longer workshops and they would have preferred if they could have attended all workshops i.e. they would prefer sequential rather than parallel sessions.</p><p>As a result, 16% of participants stated that their expectations had been exceeded, 74% said their expectations had been met, 5% were not sure and another 5% stating that their expectations had not been met. </p>"

The GLRSF also outlines the coordinated UN response in support of the implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation (PSC) Framework for the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes region.</p><p>Endorsed in March 2016 by the UN Security Council, the Great Lakes Regional Strategic Framework is supported by a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) which ensures the framework is fully operational and reinforced by effective inter-agency collaboration. During the meeting, donors will be encouraged to financially contribute to the Fund.</p><p>UNCTAD is the latest Agency to begin participation in the regional trust fund, and it is expected that the Agency will use its leading role in the UN Inter-Agency Cluster on Trade and Productive Capacity to help the framework team to broaden the scope of its work on economic development and trade.</p><p>A specific area of expertise UNCTAD could offer in the Great Lakes Region is leveraging informal cross-border trade for the empowerment of women. UNCTAD is currently addressing trade barriers affecting informal female traders in Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia, and could possibility replicate these activities in the Great Lakes Region. </p>"

<p>It would be recalled six students were kidnapped in Lagos State Model College, Igbonla about 64 days ago.</p>
<p>The students were released on Friday in Ondo State.</p>
<p>Ashafa also noted that security operatives deserved a level of commendation over the safety of the released students.</p>
<p>He said, “It is glorious to say that after 64 days of heightened pressure on the Police and other Security operatives to secure the release of the students earlier than now, there is a success story at the end.</p>
<p>“We should also commend the professionalism and maturity displayed by the Police that brought this huge relief that climaxed the whole experience at the end of the day. Hopefully, the Police will get the culprits arrested and punished. This is important to serve as deterrence to other ill-minded individuals planning to engage in the condemnable act of kidnapping.”</p>
<p>He subsequently urged the Lagos State government to create “avenues that would relieve the kidnapped students of the ‘horrible’ experiences they must have gone through.”</p>

<p>While most male visitors to her wall respected the warning, one man decided to put her to the test.</p>
<p>A user called Ryan located her Instagram account from the link in her Tinder profile and decided to slide into her DMs.</p>
<p>He sent her a barrage of sexually explicit private messages – which Madison didn’t respond to – and then topped it all off with a photo of his penis at 6.13am.</p>
<p>This sent Madison raging.</p>
<p>Madison used her super sleuth skills to figure out who the guy was, using the full name and location he had on his Instagram bio.</p>
<p>She then managed to find his Facebook account, and worked out who his mother was.</p>
<p>Madison, a student of Arizona State University in Phoenix, United States, then proceeded to forward a screenshot of the offending message to his mum, asking her to ask her son to stop sending such images to women.</p>
<p>Madison received a reply from the guy’s mum the next day – in both English and Spanish – apologising profusely for her son’s behaviour.</p>
<p>The story gets worse though. Much worse.</p>
<p>When contacted by <em>Buzzfeed</em>, the man denied everything, and accused Madison of ‘illegal’ activity by sharing photos that she couldn’t prove were from him.</p>
<p>He even had the audacity to bring up ‘consent’, saying: “I will say this. If that was ‘me,’ what she did was illegal. You can’t share those types of ‘private’ pics without consent. I am not sure if you are aware of that.</p>
<p>As reported by <em>Metro</em>, Madison counters, “If this is a continuing trend, I hope not only myself, but others will shut down dick pics either by sending it to the users’ moms, or in their own creative way.”</p>
<p>She adds, “It’s just a matter of getting the minority to understand that it’s unacceptable and gross, which is what led me to messaging his mother.<br>
“I’m just glad that I could create more awareness.”</p>

<p>“I know it is important because I have played with him at international level. But now is not a good time to discuss it. We have a match on Saturday, and after the match we will be able to talk about it,” Silva said.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows what I think about Neymar. He is my friend, we have been playing together at international level for seven years. We have a very open relationship. This is the moment where he must decide.”</p>
<p>If those comments suggest a deal could be completed soon, Paris coach Unai Emery insists he is focusing purely on the players he currently has at his disposal. They include new signings Dani Alves and Yuri Berchiche, the two full-backs.</p>
<p>“For me, the best players in the world are in our dressing room,” Emery said on Friday.</p>
<p>“The transfer window shuts on August 31. A lot of clubs start the season and will maybe have a very different team by the time the window closes,” added Emery, who is without the banned Angel di Maria and the unfit Julian Draxler here.</p>
<p>– Overseas odyssey –<br>
Monaco are already a very different team to the one that won the Ligue 1 title in such style last season, with Bernardo Silva and Benjamin Mendy joining Manchester City, Tiemoue Bakayoko going to Chelsea and Valere Germain moving to Marseille, among others.</p>
<p>Those sales have raised in excess of 150 million euros, and Mbappe could reportedly bring in as much as 180 million euros more.</p>
<p>Spanish sports daily Marca reported on Tuesday that an agreement had been reached “in principle” for Real Madrid to pay that amount for the 18-year-old.</p>
<p>Of course, the French international forward, who hails from the Paris suburbs, is also a target for PSG.</p>
<p>But while Monaco have made new signings including Belgium midfielder Youri Tielemans, they cannot afford to lose any more of their title-winning stars and at least Mbappe will be there for their first official game as new champions.</p>
<p>The match, which kicks off at 8pm local time (1900 GMT), brings together France’s reigning champions and Cup holders and comes a week before the Ligue 1 season begins.</p>
<p>PSG have won the last four editions as the champions but are in this year’s event as French Cup winners having lost their league title to the principality side.</p>
<p>This is the ninth straight year the game has been staged outside France. It came to Tangiers in 2011, when Marseille beat Lille 5-4, while bizarrely PSG beat Lyon last year in an almost empty stadium in Klagenfurt, Austria.</p>
<p>Going abroad is part of the French league’s attempts to increase global interest in their competition, although bringing Neymar to Ligue 1 and keeping Mbappe there is surely a better way to attract attention from outside.</p>

<p>The tumor, known as glioblastoma, is a particularly aggressive brain tumor affecting adults. It is of the same category of cancer that led to the death of another icon of the US Senate, Ted Kennedy, who died in 2009 at age 77.</p>
<p>Days after the diagnosis, McCain was on a plane returning to Washington, where he cast a series of critical votes on health care.</p>
<p>Early Friday during one of the most tense Senate votes in years, his opposition helped sink the latest Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare.</p>
<p>McCain chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, and he had hoped to be in Washington to shepherd a massive defense spending bill through the chamber.</p>
<p>That task will now be handled by other senators.</p>

		<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><em> Mr. Olusola Amore (A retired Commissioner of Police)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To tame mob action, it is important that the law enforcement agencies do their bits and government should ensure that justice is dispensed on time. I read a news item this morning (Thursday) and I was very happy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It had to do with a judgment given by an Osogbo Magistrate’s Court in respect of a mother and grandmother that dumped their baby into a bush. This matter happened on July 4, 2017 and judgment has been given even within one month.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is the frustration of people with the justice system that causes mob action. If you look at our administration of justice system, the police will arrest a suspect and charge him/her to court, but the matter can drag for years.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The court will grant the accused bail and the person goes back to the community. The community will be alleging that the police have let the ‘criminal’ off the hook. So, they believe that if the system cannot give them justice, then they better do it themselves.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

    </div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All we need to do is to oil the machinery of criminal justice administration to run smoothly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Let the police conduct  good investigations; when the case gets to the court, let justice be dispensed on time and let us expand our prisons so that convicts will learn one or two vocations or skills while serving so that they will become productive members of the society after coming out from prison. It should not be that they go to prisons to connect to criminal gangs and form a formidable gang that will trouble people when they come out.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To curb mob action, we need to look at our criminal justice system. Justice should be dispensed expeditiously instead of cases dragging on for so long that will enable ‘criminals’ to get off the hook.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Unemployment may also make people embark on mob action. The devil finds work for idle hands.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If there are so many youths that gather around and there is no job, and there is a shout of “thief, thief,” they are bound to take the law into their own hands. So, we should also look at engaging the hands and minds of our youths productively and meaningfully.</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li><em> Mr. Bayo Oyedele (A Port Harcourt-based legal practitioner)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There should be serious punitive measures for anybody involved in mob justice. There should be a working policy to guard against mob action. I think there is an existing law in this regard; it is just that people need to be made aware that there is such a law and that we are in an environment where laws can be effective.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">People should not become Lords unto themselves. The government should organise public enlightenment programmes to dissuade people from taking part in dishing out mob justice.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Many of our people are not aware or they claim not to be aware that even when a criminal is caught in the act, he has a right until he is pronounced guilty. The law still sees such a person as innocent of whatever crime he or she is being accused of. Unfortunately, the challenges people are having in taking matters to court is that matters linger in court and some people have lost interest in the court process. So, they feel they can have it their way.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That is a wrong perception about the whole thing. People should not take the law into their own hands.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is a civil society where things should be done properly. If somebody is seen to have committed a crime, the person should be reported to law enforcement agencies and let the law take its course.  Even when people are caught in crime, they should be taken to court. They should stop handing down instant punishments on suspected criminals because sometimes, some people are innocent, and are just victims of the situation they find themselves.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The administration of criminal justice should also be improved without delay to build public confidence. For instance, in the case of the four University of Port Harcourt students – Aluu 4 – that were killed in Aluu community, Imo State, those involved were identified. let the law take its course.</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li><em> Mr. Hillary Bisong (Member, Cross River State House of Assembly)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The issue of mob justice has become very pronounced lately. It is so because there is a systemic failure of governance. What you see as mob justice is an expression of lack of confidence in government and security agencies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The people feel that they are no longer protected in the society and that is why they have chosen to take the law into their own hands. What they are doing is not recognised by the law, but they are trying to say that people are not meant for the law; rather, the law is meant for the people. Their actions show total lack of confidence in the judiciary and security system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> A suspected armed robber or cultist is captured and within a few days, you find the suspected criminal back in the society walking freely because he has paid money to the police. So, when you see mob action, people are trying to express their annoyance over total neglect by the security agencies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, their action is not right as it would stop the security agencies from getting relevant information from suspects who are killed without investigation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Intelligence gathering is normally hampered when a mob action is taken. The way out is to have community engagement in tackling security challenges.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There should be deliberate efforts to constantly engage the people in town hall meetings on how best to handle security challenges in communities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There must be political will to reassure people on improved security while ensuring that those arrested are not granted bail to become threats to society again. People must begin to see that they can be protected by security agencies and once the confidence is there, the issue of mob justice will stop.</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li><em> Usman Abdul (President, Campaign for Democracy)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is because the police have relatively failed in the provision of security of lives and property that people embark on jungle justice. It is quite unfortunate. People should learn not to take the law into their hands too.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There was a recent case in the Ikorodu area of Lagos State during the onslaught against suspected members of the Badoo cult group, where residents mistakenly lynched a celebrity. Other suspected cult members were also killed without trial. This shows the evil of a mob action. We cannot bring back the lives lost to mob actions. Our society, which is ruled by law, must not descend into a place of brutal killings and bloodshed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I recommend that the police and other security agencies wake up to their primary responsibility of the security of lives and property. When the people have faith in the police, mob actions will cease.</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li><em> Abdullahi Jalo (Abuja-based legal practitioner/politician)</em></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">People resort to mob justice as a demonstration of lack of confidence in the system of administering justice. To discourage mob justice, therefore, we all must make our judicial system work. Criminals must be punished for crimes committed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done to all parties. This will build confidence in the judicial system and people will not resort to self-help.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Government at all levels must work together to strengthen the judiciary which is the last hope of the common man.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A citizen must be able to have access to justice and get justice when he is wronged. Nobody should be made to feel he or she is above the law.</p>

<p>Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, on Friday met behind closed doors with the Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.</p>

<p>Although he did not disclose the subject of his discussion with Osinbajo, the governor told State House correspondents that his interaction with Buhari in London showed that God has answered Nigerians’ prayers.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>He said, “Let me thank God for the life of the President and thank God for Nigerians too. I also appreciate Nigerians who have prayed sincerely and earnestly for Mr. President and I think God has actual answered the prayers of Nigerians.</p>
<p>“From what you could see from the photographs, you could see that God has actually answered our prayers, so some of us were quite excited to see Mr. President.</p>
<p>“He welcomed us, discussed with us and he was also happy to see us.</p>
<p>“So, what you are seeing both on television and newspapers are genuine and correct. God has actually healed our President and we thank God for that.”</p>
<p>When asked, Emmanuel refused to disclose the details of the discussion the governors had with Buhari.</p>
<p>He however assured Nigerians that the discussion was in the interest of the nation.</p>
<p>“I don’t think when you hold meeting, even with your wife and children, you will come and make that public.</p>
<p>“The President is the father of the nation and we represent the sub-units of this nation and so it is not everything that we discussed that we should just come and say.</p>
<p>“It was a closed door meeting, but be assured that whatever the President will discuss with the governors will be in the best interest of all the citizens of this country,”he said.</p>
<p>When asked to give an idea of when Buhari should be expected back in the country, Emmanuel said he could not do so because he is not a doctor.</p>
<p>He also noted that the President’s return day is not the issue but the fact that God has healed him.</p>
<p>The governor said, “I am not a medical doctor. Let me say something here, even when you have a biological father, you love your father, you take interest in his well being.</p>
<p>“I mean, as a father to the nation, in my personal opinion, I don’t think that is the issue now. The issue is that we should thank God that God has answered our prayers, that is where I am coming from.</p>
<p>“Let me also say, some of us behave as if the President and the governors are super humans.</p>
<p>“We are normal human beings, we also have challenges. So let us not think that because we are governors or President, we are superhuman.</p>
<p>“We are not God, we are mere mortals like any of us here. So that should also make us play down on the way we look at certain issues.”</p>
<p>Emmanuel had on Wednesday joined six other state governors to visit Buhari at the Abuja House, London.</p>
<p>The six others governors are Abdulaziz Yari (Zamfara); Dave Umahi (Ebonyi), Umar Ganduje (Kano), Kashim Shettima (Borno), Samuel Ortom (Benue), and Abiola Ajimobi (Oyo).</p>

<p>Commercial activities were grounded, while some commercial banks were, on Friday, shut in Owerri, Imo State, as thousands of Indigenous People of Biafra converged on the city from the other four South East and some South South states, calling for the secession of Nigeria.</p>
<p>This is even as a coalition of Imo Council of Youths, One Nigeria Group, Nigeria Youths Unity Group and Youth Assembly of Nigeria have warned the IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu from holding any rallying in the state.</p>
<p>At a press briefing in Owerri on Friday, the coordinators of the various youth bodies, Azunnaya Andrew, Emeka Igwe, GTC Samuel and Jeff Nwoha, said they would resist any activity or programme which seeks to threaten the country’s sovereignty.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Andrew said the youth group which he coordinates was totally against any move which will put to question the unity of the country.</p>
<p>The youth leader said, “One Nigeria Group stands for oneness of Nigeria. We totally condemn the pro-Biafra rally, which is going on in Owerri now, and which is being conducted by one Nnamdi Kanu.</p>
<p>“Even in the midst of marginalisation, we are supporting the governments of Muhammadu Buhari and Rochas Okorocha. We will not allow them to hold such rally in Imo State again.”</p>
<p>On his part, Igwe, who chairs Nigeria Youth Unity Group, said Biafra was not the solution to the problems of Ndigbo.</p>
<p>He said, “We are for the unity of Nigeria despite the injustices. We are not ready for war. The event of the Nigeria civil war is still fresh in our minds. These pro-Biafra youths are very inexperienced.”</p>
<p>Samuel, who is the speaker of Youth Assembly of Nigeria, said instead of a Sovereign State of Biafra, the youths of the South East were in support of the restructuring of the country.</p>
<p>According to him, “These pro-Biafra youths need orientation. What we support is restructuring, not secession. IPOB lacks orientation. Nigeria’s unity is non-negotiable. No war, no separation.”</p>
<p>Nwoha said the youths were in support of Buhari and Okorocha, calling on the government to grant resource control to states, especially oil-bearing communities, adding that the measure will help to calm frayed nerves.</p>
<p>The state commissioner of police, Chris Ezike, who spoke to our correspondent on the phone said the pro-Biafra rally was being closely monitored by his command, assuring residents and visitors of their safety .</p>
<p>As of the time of filing this report, Kanu had yet to arrive, this is even as his multitude of supporters barricaded the Warehouse Junction, causing heavy traffic in the state capital.</p>

<p>While the Pentagon has long planned for the possibility of conflict with North Korea, the blunt language in the statement marked a departure from previous public reactions to missile tests.</p>
<p>Those earlier reactions typically decried the tests but did not emphasize military options.</p>
<p>Pentagon chief Jim Mattis, who is currently on vacation, slammed North Korea’s first test launch of an ICBM on July 4 as a “provocation,” but stressed then that the United States seeks a diplomatic solution to the standoff.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said Friday: “We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bezos leapfrogged Gates, who has been the richest man on the planet since 2013, after a rise in the share price of Amazon ahead of its latest results due later on Thursday.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to the <em>Forbes</em>’ index, the rise pushed the value of Bezos’s fortune to $91bn, compared with Gates’ wealth of $90bn.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But as Amazon shares fell back, Gates regained the top spot.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Their riches are calculated on the share prices of their respective companies and at the current values, Bezos’s stake is twice as big as the carmaker Ford.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Amazon shares have soared this year, making the company worth more than $500bn and boosting Bezos’s wealth, as he owns 17 per cent of the company, according to <em>The Guardian</em>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He also has a number of other investments, including in Google, Uber, Twitter and airbnb, worth more than $5bn.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At the start of 2017, Bezos was ranked the fourth richest in the world, behind Gates, the investor Warren Buffett and Amancio Ortega, who founded Inditex, the company behind retailer Zara.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ward executive cited various alleged anti-party activities allegedly perpetrated by the legal adviser as one of the reasons for his suspension.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a statement by the Acting Secretary of the ward, Taofeek Ajani-Balogun, the ward explained the decision to suspend Banire from the party was reached during the ward meeting held to review the last council poll.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The statement partly read, “After a critical assessment of individual activities and the performance of the party during the last election, members of the party in Ward C, Ilasamaja Mushin, unanimously voted for immediate suspension of Muiz Banire from participating in party activities in the ward and recommended his removal from office as National Legal Adviser.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Also in a statement, the Acting Chairman of the APC in Mushin LGA, Mr. Sola Osobajo, said, “After receiving the minutes of the Ward C meeting, and having carefully considered the decision of Ward C leadership, we decided to adopt the resolution for further necessary action at the state and national levels. The party leadership in Mushin further recommended to the state chapter the expulsion of Banire from the party.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, Banire in a statement he signed on Thursday dismissed the suspension.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “If these crooked elements were members of the party, they would know that by the constitution of the APC, it is the National Executive Committee that can remove a national officer of the party responsible for the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I urge the members of the public to ignore these undesirable and mischievous elements together with their antics.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A 37 year-old civil servant in Kwara State, Mr Biodun Baba, was on Thursday arraigned in a magistrate’s court in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital. The court is presided over by Mr Ahmad Dasuki.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Baba, who is said to be a primary school teacher and a member of the All Progressives Congress, was accused of making uncomplimentary and inciting post on his <em>Facebook</em> page against the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The offences, according to the Judicial Form 2 issued by the court, were contrary to sections 113, 114, 393, 394 of the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria and sections 883 and 204 of the Criminal Code Act.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The complainant, Alhaji Jimoh Adesina, who is the party Chairman, Kwara Central Senatorial District, Ilorin, accused Baba, who is of Ile Kolawole Gambari Ward 1, Ilorin East Local Government Area of engaging in acts cpable of inciting “disturbance of public peace, injurious falsehood, printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory and insult to a religion.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “Since July, 2017, the accused, through his walls on <em>Facebook,</em> has been inciting the public against the Kwara-Central Senatorial District representative at the upper chambers, Dr Olubukola Saraki, the incumbent Senate President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Baba has been exerting undue influence on innocent persons which is a threat to public peace by spreading falsehood which has caused and still causing disaffection, pandemonium among the citizens of Kwara State and beyond by disparaging the person of the Senate President, the good people of Kwara-Central Senatorial District, which he represents.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The last straw that broke the camel’s back was the dissemination of false and untrue information accentuated with malice about the third citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the whole world, urging the public not to vote for him as a senator in 2019 in the column of his FB of July 3, 2017 by 9.54pm. The statement, in fact, is credited to the accused person after necessary investigation was carried out.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A twist, however, emerged after the matter was called up and the counsel for the complainant, Mr Sikiru Solagberu, informed the court that his client wrote a letter to him to withdraw the case from the court.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The complainant counsel read the letter to the presiding magistrate and informed him that he received the letter on July 26, 2017 informing him to withdraw the case against Baba.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He urged the court to grant his application for the withdrawal of the case.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Counsel for the accused, Mr Sambo Muritala, said his client would ordinarily not object to the complainant’s letter to withdraw.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He, however, said it was safer for the complainant’s counsel to make proper application before the court and support it with an affidavit.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After listening to the arguments, the magistrate later adjourned the matter till August 3 for ruling on the application to withdraw the case.</p>

<p>Uzbekistan said Friday that it has jailed the eldest daughter of late president Islam Karimov, Gulnara Karimova — once a prominent socialite, fashion designer and singer — after charging her with massive fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p>In a statement the Uzbekistan Prosecutor-General’s Office said that “Gulnara Karimova has been charged” with crimes including fraud, money laundering and concealing foreign currency “and she has been held behind bars”.</p>
<p>Karimova, 45, is the eldest daughter of the late authoritarian president of the secretive ex-Soviet Central Asian state, who died following a reported stroke in September last year.</p>
<p>She was once tipped to succeed her father and was a high-profile figure, serving in diplomatic posts including as ambassador to Spain and Uzbekistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>She also organised a fashion week, had her own jewellery line and released pop singles under the name Googoosha as well as running entertainment television channels.</p>
<p>In a statement, the organised crime unit of the Prosecutor-General’s Office said she was a member of an organised criminal group that controlled assets worth more than $1.3 billion in 12 countries.</p>
<p>It said these included London properties worth £22.9 million ($29.95 million) and hotels in Dubai worth $67.4 million.</p>
<p>Among the long list of allegations against Karimova are that she fraudulently acquired assets worth $595 million and received $869.3 million in kickbacks that were paid into offshore accounts.</p>
<p>She has been reportedly under house arrest in the country since 2014 after publicly feuding with her mother and her younger sister Lola on Twitter. She did not attend her father’s funeral.</p>
<p>The statement by the Prosecutor-General’s office says that she was handed a five-year non-custodial sentence, that did not see her jailed, in 2015.</p>
<p>In an interview with the BBC in December, her London-based son Islam Karimov Jr., 23, called on authorities in Uzbekistan to prove that his mother was alive and well.</p>
<p>Karimova is also the subject of a multi-year corruption probe targeting Western telecoms firms that US and European investigators say paid her billions of dollars to secure access to the national market.</p>
<p>Swiss prosecutors reportedly questioned her in Tashkent in December, quashing rumours of her possible death.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t know exactly why the tipper driver was stopped but immediately the accident happened, the policemen around the area made effort to leave the scene but were attacked by the mob,” a witness said.</p>
<p>The witness said that the victims were standing by the roadside to board a vehicle to their destination when they met their untimely death.</p>
<p>Another witness said that the mob spontaneously chased the policemen and beat up two of them, while the others escaped with their guns.</p>
<p>According to reports, the factory along the road, where the policemen were on special duty, was set ablaze by the mob.</p>
<p>The incident later forced police from Okpoko Police Station in Onitsha to carry out a mass arrest of persons along the busy road.</p>
<p>Reacting, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs Nkeiru Nwode, expressed dismay over the development, saying the youths should have reported the matter to the police.</p>
<p>“It was just an accident. Three people died on the spot and their remains have been deposited at the mortuary.</p>
<p>“The scene of the accident has also been barricaded and the police are in control of the situation,” she said.</p>
<p>Nwode said the police were against unlawful assembly and would not relent in efforts to maintain peace and order in the state.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Those who want financial security during their retirement years must make sure that they aren’t among those who are spending more than they make. If you are saving less than five per cent of your gross income, you are likely in over your head. A savings rate below five per cent means you could be in real danger of financial ruin if someone in your family were to have a medical emergency or your need to carry out an impromptu project. Ideally, everyone should try to save as much as they can but in terms of targets, the rule most financial advisors suggest is 10 per cent of your gross income. Beginning at age 30, if you were to save 10 per cent of your N1, 000,000 annual income or N100,000 every year, and earn an annual rate of return of five per cent, that money would grow to more than N10,000,000 by the time you are 65.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>You have no emergency fund</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Part of the reason you need savings is to pay, in cash, for those inevitable emergency purchases like if your car has a major fault or you get hit with an excruciatingly high bill. Financing these kinds of expenses with a loan will only continue the cycle of living beyond what you can afford. Try to build an emergency fund of about N50, 000; that way, you at least have a cushion when an unexpected expense crops up. Try to do this within six months and set aside as much as possible each month towards the goal. This is not your total emergency fund. It is simply a place to start.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>No money left at the end of the month</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">People who live on paycheck to paycheck often believe that they can’t save money or spend less because their lifestyle has become a habit. However, there are typically at least one or two small ways you can cut back; like trading a pricey cable bill for Netflix, which is cheaper and can be split among friends. An easy way to jump-start savings and become more conscious of your spending decisions is to enact a no-spend month. Allow yourself to spend money only on the bare necessities for 30 days —rent, bills, groceries— and cut out everything else. No clothes shopping, no eating out, and especially no online splurging. Nothing puts your finances in check more than a consumption detox.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Bills are spiraling out of control</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Buying on credit and paying by installment has become a pastime. It’s much easier to buy a new flat screen TV when the salesman breaks down the price in monthly installments. The problem is that all of these bills start to add up and you end up nickel and diming yourself into bankruptcy. If your monthly income is being sliced and diced to pay for dozens of unnecessary installment purchases and services, you are likely in over your head. Lay out all of your monthly bills on your kitchen table and go through them one by one. Some of the best places to find savings include your telephone bills, utility bills (turn off the lights, don’t run the air conditioner if nobody is home) and your entertainment expenses (you could start to dine out less and pack lunch for work).</p>

		<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Federal Government on Thursday said it would send the 2018 budget proposal to the National Assembly at the beginning of October this year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Minister of Budget and National Planning, Senator Udo Udoma, disclosed this in Abuja during a public dialogue with top government officials, members of civil society organisations and the Organised Private Sector, among others, on the 2018-2020 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said the decision to submit the 2018 budget proposal early was in line with provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2000.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

    </div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Udoma noted that the early submission of the budget proposal to the lawmakers would give them enough time to consider the fiscal document and pass it on time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The minister said the overall goal of the government was to ensure that the country returned to a predictable budget year, which would run from January to December.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He stated, “We are having extensive consultations and all the inputs from the various consultations will be taken into consideration in preparing the MTEF and Fiscal Strategy Paper.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The MTEF outlines the Federal Government’s fiscal policies and our macroeconomic projections for the next three years from 2018 to 2020, and it provides the broad framework for the 2018 budget.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“And as you know, we are committed to delivering the 2018 budget to the National Assembly by the beginning of October, and this is part of that process.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Explaining the parameters for the 2018 budget, he said that the Federal Government was targeting to spend the sum of N7.9tn as against N7.44tn this year, adding that the fiscal deficit was expected to rise to N2.77tn from N2.35tn in the 2017 fiscal year and that there was no need for Nigerians to panic about the country’s debt burden.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Udoma added that the nation’s debt profile was sustainable as it was still within the threshold approved by the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2007.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to the minister, there is no country in the world that does not borrow, nothing that the Federal Government was well capable of meeting its obligations to creditors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We are maintaining our deficit and debts within sustainable limits. Debt financing will be restructured gradually in favour of foreign financing as part of the strategy to lower debt service burden and free up more fiscal space for the private sector,” he added.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The minister said the government was targeting total oil production volume of 2.3 million barrels per day, with an oil price benchmark of $45 per barrel.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He added that the plan of the government in 2018 was to reduce inflation rate to 12.42 per cent with a Gross Domestic Product growth rate of 4.8 per cent and nominal GDP of N133.97tn.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In terms of revenue projections, Udoma stated that the government was targeting the sum of N5.16tn for 2018 as against N5.08tn in 2017.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Of this amount, N2.1tn is to be generated from oil revenue; non-oil revenue is expected to contribute N1.36tn; dividend from Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas, N29.58bn; and revenue from minerals and mining, N1.06bn.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Others are independent revenue from agencies of government, N847.9bn; domestic recoveries and fines, N364bn; other Federal Government recoveries, N138.43bn; and grants and donor funding, N281.6bn.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In terms of expenditure, the minister explained that the government was planning to spend the sum of N2.63tn on non-debt recurrent expenditure, while N350bn would be set aside for special intervention programmes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For capital expenditure, Udoma said the sum of N2.4tn would be spent on capital projects’ implementation as against the N2.17tn approved for 2017.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We are addressing the recurrent and capital spending imbalance. Government will continue to allocate at least 30 per cent of its budgeted expenditure to capital projects,” he added.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The minister described the targets of the government in 2018 as ambitious, but noted that they were achievable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “In line with the goals of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan 2017-2020, the medium term fiscal policies of government will be directed at achieving macroeconomic stability, accelerating growth, intensifying economic diversification and promoting inclusiveness.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The need to look onwards to boost non-oil revenues cannot be overemphasized as we diversify. We are on track to achieve full recovery and return firmly to the path of growth. Fiscal prudence must be observed at all levels of governance.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The event was attended by the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed;  Director-General, Budget Office of the Federation, Mr. Ben Akabueze; and Director-General, Debt Management Office, Mrs. Patience Oniha, among others.</p>

		<p>Many people are too blinded by love to realise that their latest squeeze is a terrible individual.</p>
<p>Here are 12 determinants to assure you that it’s time to drop him/her like hot potato:</p>
<p><strong>• S/he doesn’t treat your body with respect.</strong> If your partner is fond of making mean comments about your body — whether you’re dressed or naked — know that it’s time to move on.</p>
<p><strong>• It’s all me, me, me.</strong> Are you actually enjoying the sex? Are you sufficiently ‘warmed up’ before the deed is done? Does it feel like you’re just a faceless tool in his sex-box? Granted, sometimes we all like to lie back and receive pleasure – but every time? No sir’ee. Good loving is all about mutual enjoyment and mutual effort. If you’re sleeping with someone who is clearly only thinking about him/herself, it’s time to find a lover who takes pleasure in your pleasure.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

    </div>
<p><strong>• Lack of respect.</strong> There’s nothing that sucks the fun out of sexy time quite like sleeping with someone who has no respect for you or your boundaries. Mutual respect should be present in and out of the bedroom. S/he should value your time, your opinion, and especially what you say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to. If your bedmate doesn’t respect you, don’t waste precious time and energy trying to prove to them all the reasons why they should.</p>
<p><strong>• They trash talk ex-partners.</strong> It’s one thing to bad mouth your ex to your mates over many pints of wine – it’s another thing entirely to slag off ex-partners to the person you’re currently diddling. If your partner badmouths his/her ex, s/he’ll do the same about you one day. Learn!</p>
<p><strong>• Refusal to wear a condom.</strong> Men love to give excuses when it comes to condom use. ‘It doesn’t feel as good.’ ‘I can’t do it with a Johnny on.’ Well, nothing is worth being put at risk of STDs or pregnancy, and if they’re cool to expose you (and themselves) to that, it’s time to say bye-bye. If your bed partner shudders at communicating about sexual safety, back away slowly and go find someone capable of interacting like an adult.</p>
<p><strong>• They’re selfish.</strong> Selfishness is an abhorrent characteristic. If the person you’re shagging constantly puts their needs before yours and seems hell bent on milking everything they can out of each of your encounters, they’re never going to make you feel anything other than unloved and under-appreciated. A good person wants to do things for the person they are with – not just greedily lap up all the love and affection you give them. Beware of those that suck you dry. Rather, seek someone that wants to give back.</p>
<p><strong>• They’re easily offended.</strong> If someone makes you feel bad about something you can’t control – chances are they’re a rotten egg. Drop a couple of human stink bombs and exit their bedroom quick smart.</p>
<p><strong>• You feel degraded.</strong> Many enjoy a playful spank or a consensual spot of throat grabbing when the moment takes you, but anything that leaves you feeling degraded is a firm No-No. Violence, name calling, humiliation. Do not stand for it. Any action that leaves you feeling degraded, that you didn’t explicitly ask for or agree to, should be taken as a huge call to flee the scene as fast as your legs can carry you.</p>
<p><strong>• Zero affection.</strong> Sure, some of the best sex is animalistic, but if the person you’re sleeping with refuses to shows you any affection, chances are s/he is a loser. Sex is the most intimate thing you can do. If you’re left feeling starved of affection, or like you’ve been used – listen to your instincts. They rarely lie. If the person you’re getting naked with doesn’t want to be sweet to you and make sure you’re having a nice time – ask yourself what are you really doing this for?</p>
<p><strong>• Hit it and quit it.</strong> If your lover is all ‘wham, bam, see ya later,’ and that’s an arrangement that leaves you feeling bummed out, it’s high time you called it off. Sex should make you feel on top of the world. Not as though you’ve been used and dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>• They lie to you.</strong> Are you being lied to? If the person you’re sleeping with has no qualms with looking into your eyes and telling you a barefaced lie, you need to brush aside this bad human immediately. People who lie are the worst. If someone lies once, they will lie again. Don’t expose yourself to a life full of uncertainty, worry and wondering – it’ll eat you up inside.</p>
<p><strong>• Manipulation.</strong> The problem with masters of manipulation is that they’re hard to spot. Warning signs include guilt-trips, assumptions about you and what you’re up-for, and telling you ex-partners used to willingly do what they’re asking of you. If someone’s doing their best to make you feel as though you owe them something, we suggest you stop sharing your bed with them immediately.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Ekeh disclosed that displaying nude pictures of herself on social media was a way of introducing to the world the ‘new Christabel’.</p>
<p>In the images she displayed on her Instagram, she was captured in a yoga sitting position and in an almost backflip position.</p>

<p>Ekeh said, “I noticed the page was taken down but it’s my way of welcoming everyone to the ‘new Christabel’</p>
<p>Asked who this ‘new Christabel’ was, the actress who has starred in movies like ‘potomanto’, and ‘sweet mistake’ answered, “it is whoever you can imagine.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m not wearing anything. So whatever you want to wear on me, that’s your imagination.”</p>
<p>The actress mother and siblings also defended her nude photos, saying she is a very decent girl and sometimes the nature of her work as an actress and model makes her go unclad for some promotional campaigns.</p>

<p>China and Russia are serious rivals in terms of volume.</p>
<p>European countries are the biggest customers, but a lot is also sold in the rest of Asia, the United States and even Africa.</p>
<p>There are about 10 major temples, and other smaller ones in India with a cut of the market. Some villages also collect their inhabitants’ hair.</p>
<p>The most expensive type — capturing a quarter of the overall market — is hair shaved directly from the scalp of one donor. The rest — cheaper cuts sourced from comb waste — fetches a lower price.</p>
<p>Some temples make pilgrims braid their hair before it is cut so that the locks all face the same direction.</p>
<p>The hair collected at Thiruthani Murugan is auctioned to processing plants which sell the finished product as all-human wigs or hair extensions.</p>
<p>Business has to move quickly at the temple, one among the six holy shrines of deity Lord Murugan.</p>
<p>From four in the morning to sundown, barbers clip away. Pilgrims queue for hours, sometimes much longer on festival days, to make their sacrifice.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands, including women and children, shave their heads here every year, applying a bright yellow paste of turmeric powder before offering their prayers.</p>
<p>Pilgrims climb 365 steps to reach the shrine, which is open year round. The profits from the sale of their hair goes towards the upkeep of the temple</p>

<p>The Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo, <span class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_992100971""><span class=""aQJ"">on Monday</span></span>, admitted that the cost of managing the humanitarian crisis caused by insurgency especially as it concerns about 2.4 million Internally Displaced Persons and extensive destruction of infrastructure is “huge and enormous.”</p>
<p>According to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr. Laolu Akande, the Acting President spoke while receiving a delegation of the African Union Peace and Security Council at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.</p>
<p>Osinbajo said countries in the Lake Chad Basin have been cooperating in dealing with the insurgency in the region and the consequent humanitarian crisis.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>He cited the progress of the Multi-National Joint Task Force set up to address the terrorist insurgency as a sign of the cooperation.</p>
<p>Osinbajo noted that unlike in the past when there were difficulties when the militaries of the four countries tried to work together, the MNJTF surmounted the challenges and has succeeded.</p>
<p>The statement read, “However he (Osinbajo) observed that the humanitarian consequences of the insurgency are compounded by deep poverty, making the costs of dealing with the situation huge and enormous.</p>
<p>“He recalled that there are for instance about 2.4m displaced persons, extensive destruction of property, infrastructure, schools, homes and farmland. In some cases, he said, the situation required the rebuilding of whole societies.</p>
<p>“But he expressed satisfaction with the work of the Peace and Security Council of the AU.”</p>

		<p>Police and opposition protestors clashed Monday in Goma, eastern Democratic of Republic of Congo, as demonstrators protested President Joseph Kabila’s sustained grip on power and called for elections.</p>
<p>Protesters and several journalists were arrested in cities across the country after the youth movement Struggle for Change (Lucha) called for marches nationwide, police and witnesses said.</p>
<p>Around 40 people were held in the eastern city of Goma, 17 in the capital Kinshasa and around 10 each in three other cities, Butembo, Bukavu and Lubumbashi, police spokesman Colonel Pierrot-Rombaut Mwanamputu told AFP.</p>
<p>The chief of police has decided that all people arrested in the context of these illegal demonstrations across the country will be released,” he added.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Several opposition coalitions and prominent figures had publicly backed the marches, timed to mark the July 31 date given by the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) to conclude a voter registration programme.</p>
<p>In Goma, the regional capital of North Kivu province, bordering Rwanda, protesters threw stones and pulled up barricades as police fired tear gas at them, said police, an AFP journalist witnessed.</p>
<p>One group managed to force police lines to deliver a statement to the offices of CENI, Independent National Electoral Commission, before being arrested.</p>
<p>Further north at Butembo, 11 activists were “brutally arrested”, a local priest told AFP.</p>
<p>And in Bukavu, the provincial capital of South Kivu, police used tear gas to break up a rally.</p>
<p>Police also detained two journalists from the private television channel Canal Futur, impounding their equipment. They were later released. A third journalist, from the local state TV station, was briefly held then released with his equipment.</p>
<p>Further west, in the capital Kinshasa, riot police were out in force in the city centre around the parliament, on foot and in motorised patrols, making seven arrests.</p>
<p>Political tension is rising steadily in DR Congo as the pressure mounts on Kabila, whose mandate expired on December 20 last year, to organise elections.</p>
<p>Under an agreement reached at the end of last year, Kabila was to hold them by the end of this year, under the aegis of the influential Roman Catholic church.</p>
<p>On July 7, however, CENI announced it would not be possible to organise elections in the vast and troubled country by the end of this year.</p>

<p>A statement by the Time Warner-owned TV group said a “cyber incident” resulted in “the compromise of proprietary information,” and that the company had contacted law enforcement and outside cybersecurity firms.</p>
<p>The statement did not indicate what was compromised, but several media reports said hackers obtained the script of a new episode of the award-winning fantasy series as well as unaired episodes of two other programs, “Ballers” and “Room 104.”</p>

<p>Such means included threats, blackmail, verbal abuse and, in more terrifying cases, while gun was being held to their heads.</p>

<p>A research project of 154 men who were reportedly ‘compelled to penetrate’ a woman found more than a fifth of them were forced into it by threats and blackmail.</p>
<p>Telling lies, threats to end a relationship, warnings of rumour-spreading and verbal abuse were cited by about two out of every 10 men in the survey.</p>
<p>The research project, led by Dr. Siobhan Weare, from Lancaster University Law School, and supported by charity Survivors Manchester, also found the use of force, such as pinning down with bodyweight or having a weapon, was reported by at least 1.4 out of every 10 men who completed the survey.</p>
<p>The project is aimed at exploring one of the ‘last taboos’ — sexual violence by women against men.</p>
<p>Weare said: “Whilst the sample size of 154 may be smaller than typically expected, this must be considered in the context of an issue that is under-reported and under-discussed, and that this is the first and only survey of its kind to be conducted in the UK.</p>
<p>“The ‘hidden’ nature of this crime and the ‘complex’ gender dynamics involved means that huge numbers of survey participants were highly unlikely — not because this isn’t happening to men, but because many are made to feel too ashamed or feel too distressed to report it.”</p>
<p>Weare said it was difficult to know the prevalence of forced-to-penetrate cases in the UK, but research in the US in 2010 found that approximately one in 21 men reported being ‘made to penetrate’ someone else during their lifetime, with 79 per cent of cases involving a female perpetrator.</p>
<p>She added: “The term “forced to penetrate” has been coined for these cases because, while they involve non-consensual penile penetration, they do not fall under the offence of rape.</p>
<p>“The offence of rape can only be committed by men due to the requirement of penile penetration of the victim. In ‘forced to penetrate’ cases, the offender is the one being penetrated by a non-consenting victim.”</p>
<p>All 154 of the UK male survey participants had experienced compelled penetration.</p>
<p>The men shared their most recent experience of being forced to penetrate a woman, as well as their engagement with the criminal justice system, how they would label what had happened to them, whether they had experienced multiple victimisation, and emotional and psychological harms.</p>
<p>The majority of the participants who completed the survey reported that they knew the woman, often as an acquaintance or a friend, and just over half were in, or had been in, a relationship with the perpetrator.</p>
<p>Only two men said that they had reported their experience to the police and in both instances, the case did not make it to court.</p>
<p>‘Rape’ was the most frequent label used by the participants in describing their ordeal, despite the law not recognising such cases in this way.</p>
<p>‘Sex’ was used least frequently.</p>
<p>The vast majority — 80 per cent — of them, did not disclose their experience to family or friends and 74 per cent had not sought support, suggesting that men are left feeling isolated and alone in dealing with their experiences.</p>
<p>Duncan Craig, the founder and chief executive of Survivors Manchester, a charity supporting males who have experienced sexual violation, said: “This really is a groundbreaking piece of work by Dr. Weare.</p>
<p>“We have got to break the silence on this and let men know that we are here to listen and support them when needed.”</p>
<p>The research project was funded by a Lancaster University Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Knowledge Exchange Grant.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But Dubois does not care which AJ is in the opposite corner as his undefeated career gathers pace.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dubois, who is 6ft  5in tall, takes on AJ Carter for the Southern Area title at the Copper Box Arena, London on September 16.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">His trainer, Martin Bowers, said, “If Klitschko called us up we’d go and spar with him. To go and get that experience and keep working with top-grade fighters is what it’s all about.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Joshua or Klitschko? whoever phones first, we go.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dubois gets a bit fidgety when he is asked about that sparring session with Joshua which took place long before AJ won his world titles.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">DD believes what happens in the gym stays in the gym. But he admits on putting Joshua down: “It let me know I have power in both hands. Other than that I take it for what it is.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Joshua won the world IBF heavyweight title in just his 16th professional bout, knocking out Charles Martin in the second round at London’s O2 Arena.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dubois’ aim is to get to the top quicker than AJ and he said: “It certainly seems possible to get there quicker than him the way I’m going.</p>

<p>The national meteorological department warned more lightning storms were expected through Tuesday.</p>
<p>Odisha has also been badly hit by floods and another three bodies were found in waters in Jajpur district, taking the region’s toll from the deluge to seven in 48 hours.</p>
<p>Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across several other Indian states, damaging roads and electricity networks, with about 700 dead reported across the country.</p>
<p>As many as 20 states have suffered in the monsoon season that began in June.</p>
<p>In the western state of Gujarat, 213 people have been killed in weeks of flooding, state disaster management officials said, almost doubling the death toll after about 100 bodies were found when water started receding.</p>
<p>Suresh Kumar, West Bengal’s top disaster management official, said 31 deaths were reported in a week of flooding in the state.</p>
<p>“Heavy rains have caused massive damage in several districts,” Kumar told AFP.</p>
<p>Landslides and flash floods in the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam since April have left dozens dead, while Jharkhand and Bihar have also been badly hit. Nearly 140 lightning deaths have been reported in Bihar since May.</p>

<p>Ex-primary school governor David Turner, 72, who once worked as a church warden, pleaded guilty on Monday to importing the child sex doll after the application to dismiss the charge by arguing that the doll was not obscene was turned down.</p>
<p>Turner, from Ramsgate, was freed on bail to be sentenced on September 8 for the importation charge and for pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to possessing or making more than 34,000 indecent images of children aged around three to 16.</p>

<p>The lifelike silicone sex aids, which weigh around 55lb and can cost thousands of pounds, are being imported into the UK after being sold by traders on sites including Amazon and eBay, according to the National Crime Agency.</p>
<p>The dolls, often manufactured in China and Hong Kong, are a “relatively new phenomenon” in the UK and should be criminalised, the operations manager at the NCA’s Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command, Hazel Stewart, said.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Members of the House of Representatives are enraged after the lawmakers could not take delivery of exotic cars worth about N6.1bn as official vehicles for the 360-member House.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Every four years, lawmakers get exotic official vehicles, better known as “utility or committee” cars, though the cars are more like the personal property of the legislators.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Investigations by The PUNCH on Sunday showed that after using personal cars to work or go on oversight duties for over two years, lawmakers had told the leadership of the House that they had had “enough of suffering.”</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">About 223 of the 360 members of the house were “freshers” who first came to the National Assembly in 2015.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The new members are said to be most pained as they have had to fuel personal cars for work since June, 2015.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the days preceding the annual recess of the members on Thursday last week, The PUNCH learnt that the members had begun to demand explanations from the Speaker, Mr. Yakubu Dogara.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, the blame was placed more on the Chairman, Committee on House Services, Mr. Nasiru Baballe-Ila, than on Dogara, for the former’s alleged role in delaying the delivery of the cars.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Findings showed that the House had contracted Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited to supply 360 units of Peugeot 508 series late in 2015.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The company is allegedly supplying each unit of the exotic vehicle at N17m, leaving the House with huge budget of N6.1bn.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An official stated, “Right from when this arrangement started, there was an undertaking that the cars would be supplied in batches.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The supply started initially with the female members in August, 2016, when the first 50 units arrived.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Later on, we started noticing hiccups in the delivery of the cars as members got more impatient.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“More than two years into a four-year tenure, only 175 members have been supplied the cars. Others are still paying from their pockets to work and the suffering continues.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Members are tired and they can no longer keep calm. It was learnt that the hiccups were caused by what the House later discovered to be ‘Peugeot’s lack of capacity’ to deliver the cars because of the huge number.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“It has got to a pathetic situation whereby members scramble for the few units that are delivered.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“As a matter of fact, they have been compelled to lobby the House Services Committee chairman so that they will be among the lucky ones to get the cars”, another National Assembly source informed The PUNCH.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It was gathered that members were particularly angry with Baballe-Ila for allegedly foisting the Peugeot brand on the House.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A source said, “It was the initial plan to go for either Toyota Land Cruiser Prado or Camry, which could be easily delivered.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“But it was Baballe-Ila who used his position as chairman to foist Peugeot on members. Now, Peugeot is unable to deliver the cars two years on.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Matters came to a head last week just before members went on break as they asked Dogara to sack Baballe-Ila.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Findings indicated that some lawmakers pointedly told Dogara that he ought to have tutored Baballe-Ila on how not to toy with members’ welfare, having been the Chairman of the House Services Committee in the 7th Assembly under Speaker Aminu Tambuwal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When The PUNCH sought the views of the Chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Mr. Abdulrazak Namdas, he merely said the Baballe-Ila committee was making efforts to ensure that every member got a car.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Namdas stated, “See, as I speak, I have yet to take delivery of a car. Truly, we all cannot get it at a go.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The committee is working on it and I think very soon, the cars will go round. We just have to be patient.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Namdas added that it was natural that people would make “simple enquiries” especially if some members were seen with cars and others did not have.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He described a recent meeting with Dogara, where members tabled the issues, as “our usual interactive session where members share ideas before going on their annual vacation.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Efforts by The PUNCH to reach Baballe-Ila failed on Sunday.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He also did not respond to text messages sent to him by our correspondent.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our correspondent was told that Simon had bought some red peppers from the woman last Monday and was supposed to collect N50 change.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It was gathered that Taiye went to visit her ailing husband at a hospital the following day and did not open shop.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The woman said hardly had she arrived at the shop on Wednesday with fresh stock when Simon came to collect the change.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She stated that she told him to come back for the change, but he suddenly resorted to force and started taking her goods.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 30-year-old woman, who spoke with our correspondent in Yoruba, said, “I explained to him that I had used all the money on me to buy peppers and begged him to give me little time to sell so that I will give him the change.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“But he dipped his hands into a basket to pack some peppers. So, I held his shirt. He freed himself from my grip and threw me into a gutter. I went to report at the Meiran Police Station and some policemen followed me to arrest him.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“On getting to the station, he spoke in English and Igbo with a police officer. Then, a policeman told me that some people beat him (Simon) and that I would be detained until they arrest those people. Simon was told to go.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The woman said she spent over 24 hours in detention and was freed after members of a pepper sellers association she belonged to paid N4,500 to secure her bail.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said, “I was locked up inside a cell. They didn’t give me food. I was feeling pains all over my body. Members of my association later contributed N4,500 before I was released in the evening of the following day (Thursday).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“My pregnancy is over seven months now. I have gone to do a scan at a hospital to know the condition of my baby. The result will be out on Monday (today).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The Commissioner of Police invited me and some policemen to his office in Ikeja on Friday. He was angry with them and told them to refund the N4,500. They asked me to come for the money on Monday (today).”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A resident, who begged for anonymity, said shortly after Taiye was released on Thursday, Simon allegedly mobilised some thugs to beat two men, Ope and Muri Waheed, who cautioned him for asaulting the woman.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Youths in the community confronted the thugs he brought and there was confusion everywhere. An elderly man tried to caution one of the thugs to no avail. On Friday, he came again with the thugs and they smashed bottles on the street.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Some policemen came, but none of the hoodlums was arrested. The Divisional Police Officer of the station and the guy (Simon) that beat the pepper seller are Igbo. We also learnt that he has a relative at the station,” he added.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Waheed’s wife, Bose, told our correspondent that he (Waheed) was arrested on Friday and detained in the station.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“He didn’t know anything about the incident. They handcuffed him; his elder brother took food to him at the station. He was released on Saturday evening,” she added.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Olarinde Famous-Cole, said neither the pregnant woman nor Waheed was detained.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said the CP had intervened in the matter, adding that some policemen were being queried in respect of the case.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “The Igbo man wanted to collect his change and she pleaded with him that she had not sold anything for the day. The guy was adamant. It was just a mere human misunderstanding. She was not detained from Wednesday to Thursday; that is not true. The case was not turned against the pregnant woman.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“All the parties involved have been invited and investigation is ongoing. Those that caused a breakdown of law and order have been arrested. The CP is aware; those officers involved are already undergoing investigations to know the police action as regards the incident. We will go to the scene to know what transpired.</p>

<p>The Peoples Democratic Party has called on the Federal Government to stop deceiving Nigerians with its claim that Boko Haram had been defeated.</p>
<p>It said events in the last few days had shown that the terror group was still very potent.</p>
<p>The party said it was sad with the claim by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Maiduguri, Prof. Ibrahim Njodi, that four of the university’s workers were still missing.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p>Njodi also said five of the university’s workers were brought to the town dead, adding that nine staff of the university were killed.</p>
<p>The spokesperson for the National Caretaker Committee of the PDP, Mr. Dayo Adeyeye, who spoke with one of our correspondents on the issue in Abuja on Sunday, said Nigerians had known that the government was lying.</p>
<p>Adeyeye stated, “The celebration of the alleged defeat of Boko Haram was premature. There was no need for that celebration. It was based on false information and distortion of facts.</p>
<p>“Now, we have seen the result that Boko Haram was not defeated and that is why the Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, ordered the Army chief to relocate to Maiduguri.</p>
<p>“This is a grand deception; you can see that.</p>
<p>“It has been a complete disaster. Of course, we can have challenges fighting Boko Haram, but they should not deceive Nigerians. That is very important.</p>
<p>“They (the government) went to start the oil exploration in order to deceive Nigerians and the international community that Boko Haram has been defeated. They will claim that after all, we are now there and exploring oil. It is all deceit.”</p>

<p>The price rise put both crude benchmarks on track for a sixth consecutive session of gains.</p>
<p>Prices have risen around 10 per cent since the last meeting of leading members by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers, including Russia.</p>
<p>At that instance, the group discussed potential measures to further tighten oil markets.</p>
<p>“U.S inventories are showing massive draw down, Saudi Arabia seems intent on playing its role as the world’s swing producer.</p>
<p>“Impending sanctions on Venezuela by the U.S will almost certainly be oil price-supportive,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at futures brokerage, OANDA.</p>
<p>The U.S is considering imposing sanctions on Venezuela’s vital oil sector in response to Sunday’s election of a constitutional super-body that Washington has denounced as a “sham” vote.</p>
<p>However, traders said the biggest price supporter was currently a tightening U.S oil market.</p>
<p>“Strong increases in the price of oil … (were) fuelled in large part by the substantial drawdowns in U.S. inventories over the past several weeks,” said William O’Loughlin, analyst at Rivkin Securities.</p>
<p>“A continuation of this trend could indicate the oil market is rebalancing thanks to the production cuts by OPEC and Russia,” he added.</p>
<p>After rising by more than 10 per cent since mid-2016, U.S oil production dipped by 0.2 per cent to 9.41 million barrels per day (bpd) in the week to July 21.</p>
<p>Drilling for new US production is also slowing, with just 10 rigs added in July, the fewest since May 2016.</p>
<p>The tighter market was also visible in the price curve, which shows backwardation in the front end.</p>
<p>Backwardation is a market condition in which prices for immediate delivery of a product are higher than those later on.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our correspondent had reported that the 68-year-old had gone for a meeting of traditional rulers in Ilaro, in the Yewa South area of Ogun State, on Wednesday.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He was said to have dropped off his driver along the way and was heading home in his Toyota Camry around 10pm when he was waylaid by some assailants between Ijako and Isagbo in the Oke-Odan area.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The men reportedly dragged him out of his car and hacked him with an axe before putting him back into the car.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The assassins then set fire to the car and fled the scene.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fasinu’s charred remains were recovered on Thursday by policemen from the Owode-Yewa division.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the police would get to the roots of the death.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ogungbeje, who said he had been Fasinu’s counsel since 2012, said he was shocked to learn of the death in <em>PUNCH</em>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The lawyer said the Ogun State Government and the state judiciary were partly to blame as the late king had had several threats to his life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “I have vowed to see the Ogun State CP tomorrow (Monday). I will give the police the names of those behind the killing of kabiyesi.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Kabiyesi had a running battle with a traditional ruler over the prescribed authority of Owoland. Owoland shares boundary with another community. The ruler of that community made some people <em>baales</em>. Oba Fasinu said it was not the man’s rights to appoint the <em>baales</em> because the villages fell under his jurisdiction.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The Ogun State Government set up a panel of enquiry in February 2012. The panel invited all the parties. Afterwards, the panel submitted its report to the government. We begged the government to release the report so that the power tussle could be laid to rest.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The government refused to release the report. I wrote two letters to the government to release the report, but the government refused.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said the matter was also taken before a judge at the state high court, but the judge dismissed it as unimportant, wondering why they were in a haste.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ogungbeje said arguments to make the judge see reason with him were abortive.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said the second list of suspects were those who fought the monarch over rights to the coronation of the chief imam of Owoland.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said some persons had made several attempts on the life of Fasinu, leading to a petition to the Ogun State Department of State Services and the state police command.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The state government and the judiciary should share blame for his death. I foresaw this. The state CP should be allowed to work without any hindrance. I will submit a petition to him on these suspects and if he didn’t take it up, we will go to the Inspector-General of Police. This man was wasted over nothing,” he added.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ogungbeje said he spoke with the deceased last Sunday when the latter demanded some documents from him.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>PUNCH Metro</em> learnt that late Fasinu was the first traditional ruler of the community.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">His daughter, Sarah Shiyanbola, said he was killed by mercenaries working for some influential people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The police and the government will do well to unveil these killers. This is what will bring joy again to our family,” she said.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Balogun of Owoland, Chief Musharaf Tairu, said a suspect was arrested on Saturday.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I will not give further details because of the sensitive nature of this case. But I want to appeal to the authorities not to shy away from their responsibilities,” he added.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>PUNCH Metro</em> had reported that Kolawole had just finished his National Youth Service Corps when he took ill.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He was said to have gone to the Ikeja Medical Centre, a private hospital in his neigbourhood, where he was treated for malaria and after a negative reaction, he was admitted for mental illness.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After spending about two weeks at the hospital, he was transferred to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He was admitted to the psychiatric ward and later went into a coma.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our correspondent reported that he was taken to the Intensive Care Unit of LASUTH when his illness became critical.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He died after spending about two months in the ICU.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Doctors at LASUTH had said he was received as a psychiatric patient, but further checks showed that his ailment was not purely a psychiatric issue, adding that he had an infection called <em>meningoencephalitis.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The workers of the Ikeja Medical Centre frustrated all efforts by <em>PUNCH Metro</em> to get their side of the story, including harassing our correspondent.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The medical certificate of the cause of death, signed by one Mgbehoma Ikenna, of the Department of Pathology and Forensic Medicine, LASUTH, said, “I hereby certify that I have performed an autopsy on the body of Kolawole Idowu, who was stated to be aged 29; that I saw him on July 4, 2017; that he was then dead; that he died as I was informed on July 1, 2017,  at about 4pm; and that the cause of death was to the best of my knowledge and belief as herein stated, la:<em>Bronchopneumonia</em>; and that the disease had continued till death.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our correspondent observed that the primary and secondary causes were cancelled by the writer, who simply stated the cause of death as <em>bronchopneumonia</em>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The victim’s mother, Osiyemi, said the family was almost done with its petition to the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria against the Ikeja Medical Centre.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She, however, expressed surprise at the report.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">She said, “I don’t know why it took such a long time for the certificate to be released to us. Ordinarily, it shouldn’t have taken this long. And now, they are telling us he died from pneumonia.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A medical expert, Dr Olubunmi Omojowolo, said it was possible that the deceased contracted the infection in the LASUTH ICU, adding that it could be the secondary cause of death.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “He could have died from pneumonia as a secondary cause. Any patient in a coma has a high risk of developing orthostatic and or aspiration pneumonia.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He advised the family to demand a comprehensive autopsy report to know other things involved in the death.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another expert, who did not want to be identified, expressed surprise at the report, saying it was abnormal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“It looks funny because they didn’t state the primary and secondary causes of death which is very unlike the pathologist. This is not standard practice,” she said.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Chief Medical Director of LASUTH, Prof. Adewale Oke, said there would be a meeting of all the doctors involved in the treatment of the deceased to ascertain what really happened.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He explained that the deceased brain had yet to undergo tests.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “We are having a meeting tomorrow (Monday). Anybody that has all the symptoms (exhibited by Kolawole), like seizures; it has to be in the brain. The brain has been sent for toxicology. However, from experience, when you put tubes in the trachea for the patient to breathe, it could lead to an infection.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The cult killed a couple – Mr. and Mrs. Adejare – two of their children, while the third kid was said to be in a coma at the Ikorodu General Hospital.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The incident happened in the early hours of Sunday in Oke Ota community, Ibeshe. The children were reportedly aged between five and one. Two of them were identified as Siyin and Ajoke, all females.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>PUNCH Metro</em> learnt that the assailants cut the window net of the family’s apartment to gain entry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">They were said to have subsequently smashed the victims’ heads with a stone and left the area unnoticed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the incident became known around 12pm when church members of the deceased checked on them on the way from church.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “They had a special programme in their church today (Sunday). The members decided to check on them because they did not come to the church. They found the whole family in a pool of blood and raised the alarm. One of the three children was still breathing. He was rushed to the general hospital.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“There are burglar-proof bars on the windows in the house, except in the kitchen. They came through the kitchen. They tore the net and entered the house.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We seem to have relaxed in securing the community because the attack subsided for some time. Even the police patrol has reduced.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another resident, who did not want his name in print, told <em>PUNCH Metro</em> that the corpses were removed by policemen from the Ipakodo division.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said the victims attended The Chosen Generation Family Church in Oke Ota, adding that a stone used by the gang was left behind.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The apartment was given to them by the church. The couple were on the bed, while the children slept on mats. Four of them were killed. Their corpses have been deposited in the Ikorodu General Hospital mortuary,” he added.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A community leader said the residents would intensify  vigils in the neighbourhood, urging the police to ensure regular patrol on streets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “We were happy that things were getting better before this incident. There is one little girl among them receiving treatment at a hospital. Her head was smashed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We only hear sirens of the police patrol from the main road. They don’t usually come into the inner parts of the community, where the <em>Badoo</em> members operate.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Lagos State police spokesperson, ASP Olarinde Famous-Cole, said the killings had no connection with the <em>Badoo</em> cult, adding that the location of the family’s residence was not accessible to vehicles.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He said, “The house is just a room and parlour with one open window and no visible form of security. A family of five were attacked. Three died on the spot, one died while receiving treatment at a hospital and the last member is alive and responding to treatment.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“No visible trace of violence or clues linked to the cult was found. No stone was found at the scene. A case of murder is being investigated by police detectives, which doesn’t fit in the modus operandi of the cult.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Three members of the All Progressives Congress, including a lawmaker in the Lagos State House of Assembly, Wasiu Sanni, have urged the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja to expel the party’s National Legal Adviser, Dr. Muiz Banire (SAN), over alleged anti-party activities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sanni, who is the current Deputy Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, filed the suit alongside Babatunde Kehinde and Alhaji Kazeem Olatunji.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> In the suit filed through their lawyer, Mr. Wahab Shittu, the plaintiffs alleged that Banire had flouted Articles 12.3, 12.4, and 12.5 of the APC Constitution 2014, among other provisions of the law and should be expelled.</p><div class=""inserted_ad"">

<p style=""text-align: justify;""> They alleged that Banire, sometime in December 2015, “orchestrated forgery by facilitating the use of false document by the Independent National Electoral Commission.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sanni, who is the first plaintiff in the suit, claimed that  the alleged forgery was intended to rob him of the victory he won at the December 2014 APC primary for the Lagos State House of Assembly by substituting his name with that of Hakeem Masha, who was the first runner-up in the primary.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> He claimed that though he won the primary by scoring186 out of the total valid votes of 279, Banire caused a letter, dated January 9, 2015, to be written to the Independent National Electoral Commission that he (Sanni) had withdrawn from the contest.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> He said in his place, the name of Masha was submitted to INEC, adding that it took the intervention of Justice Ibrahim Buba of the Federal High Court in Lagos to restore his mandate to him.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> The plaintiffs are, through their lawyer, Shittu, urging the court to declare that Banire flouted “Article 21 (a) (2) of the provisions of the Constitution of the All Progressives Congress 2014 by engaging in anti-party activities likely to embarrass or have adverse effect on the party or bring the party into hatred, contempt, ridicule or disrepute by reasons of the several actions of the defendant before, during and after the entire process of APC local government primaries in Lagos State.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">They want the court to, among others, declare that “having breached the established legal principles, including but not limited to the provisions of the Constitution of the APC 2014, the defendant be removed as the National Legal Adviser of the APC.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> In the alternative, they are praying the court to make an order “directing/mandating the leadership of the APC to take appropriate disciplinary measures against the defendant with a view to forestalling a situation likely to cause a breach of peace in the Lagos State chapter of our party and Nigeria in general.”</p>
